<p>Lmao. The first time I went camping my friends told me that when it came to bears, you only have to outrun the slowest person, and you will survive. I was still scared. But the ONLY time that everyone saw a bear, was when I was napping. Unfair</p>

    <div class="post"><p>Reading through the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/lib.html">library</a> of YCombinator, came across <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">this</a> awesome "lesson on elementary worldly wisdom" by Charlie Munger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6% return—even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result.</p>
<p>So the trick is getting into better businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warren Buffett was a true "Grahamite", and started by investing only in the businesses available at cheap valuations (and even liquidate them if required).</p>
<p>However, Munger realized "that some company that was selling at 2 or 3 times book value could still be a hell of a bargain." It was then that they started thinking about better businesses.</p>
<p>And the "bulk of the billions in Berkshire Hathaway have come from the better businesses."</p>
<p><strong>Do read the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">complete lesson</a> if you love investing.</strong></p>

<p>Charlie Rose: Did you have what you now have (this fascination and love for science)...for a while? Was this something that was in you? As a kid, were you interested in science? </p>
<p>Bill Gates: Absolutely....In my 20's and 30's, during the creation and my hyper-focus on Microsoft, I read a little bit of science...but I had to know one thing super, super well. And so I've been able to broaden my being up-to-date on science and meet with great scientists as part of this foundation work, and that's a real pleasure.</p>
<p>Charlie Rose: Now that's an interesting idea, let's just stay with that for a second. You said that in order to do what you did with Microsoft, you had to what? As you once said to me, you just had to focus on that at all times and other things suffered. Is that simply the price of building a company like Microsoft?</p>
<p>Bill Gates: I think the world's best companies are built by fanatics. And when you're in your 20's and 30's, being fanatical comes...at least it came pretty natural to me....I wanted to let everybody have cool software. And so I didn't feel bad that that's what I was doing. [He went to say that now in his 50's, backing great scientists in different areas and not being fanatical about one thing is what now comes naturally to him.]
...
Charlie Rose: Help me understand what it takes to build a Microsoft, or to build an Apple, or to build a Facebook...in terms of what it is that you and Mark and Steve had? </p>
<p>Bill Gates: Well, in each of those cases, you had people who were quite fanatical about...</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Rose: Now what does fanatical mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bill Gates: Work day and night. Sort of don't worry about the possibility of failure. Every setback is just something to work a little bit harder at doing. And you really know what you're trying to achieve. And you're going to hire the best people. And you're going to change your strategy until you can get that to happen.</strong></p>

    <p class="meta sub"><a href="2013/02/04/bill-gates-letter/"><small>Mon 04 February 2013</small></a>
    </p>

  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post"><p>Bill Gates hits the bulls-eye in this open letter dated February 3, 1976. The line that strikes me the most is that <em>"most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share."</em> Something that is abnormally common in India.</p>
<p>The complete letter (via <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2009/10/most-of-you-steal-your-software.html">LettersOfNote</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="Open Letter by Bill Gates" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2474/3991297476_1dc98a1d14_o.png" /></p>
<p>I now realise the perils of piracy in India. Being addicted to piracy, and getting mp3s and movies for free, we now assume the net to be free. Software is the last thing we like to pay for. <strong>And probably this is the reason why we neither have "good softwares being written" nor a Facebook or Google marked <em>‘made in India’</em>.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Update:</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461490/piracy">Bill Gate's response to Windows Piracy in China, in 1998:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although about 3 million computers get sold every year in China, people don’t pay for the software. Someday they will, though, and as long as they’re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. <strong>They’ll get sort of addicted, and then we’ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is actually what is happening now as all the laptops are preloaded with genuine Windows. The lesson can be summarized as:</p>
<p>Step 1: If you want to make a great software, and keep it alive, then make it paid.<br />
Step 2: Don't lose the market. Those who can't pay, give them free and make them addicted.  </p>
