title: What comes first - ideas or logics?


<p>Either of those can come first. What is important is that the other should follow.  You might read an interesting quote, be told about a good investment, develop a liking for something, want to take an impulsive decision…; since these all are controlled by left brain, it is necessary and helpful to support it with proper logics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might have finished with lot of theory, attended an interesting talk, read a news article, read a good book…; these are processed by right brain. To get accustomed to them, one needs to apply them practically and develop it as a part of left brain.</p>

<p>To summarize, if a new thought / idea comes, then develop logics. And if a new thing is learnt, then try to develop a mental model for it.</p>
