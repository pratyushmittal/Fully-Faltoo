<p>This is my favorite poem. The Wimbledon matches begin by reading this poem. Similar thing was done this time in IPL-Final too (poem was sung by Sunil Gavaskar, Harsha Bhogle, Ravi Shastri and other legends).</p>

<p>If anyone has the video of the &#8220;If&#8221; poem sung in IPL, the please do share.</p>
