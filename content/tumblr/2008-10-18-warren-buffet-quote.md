<blockquote>A simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.</blockquote>&#8212;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/opinion/17buffett.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin" target="_blank">Warren Buffett</a>, who so often delights me by confirming a hunch that a) this stuff is not as complicated as it looks, and b) youâ€™ll never <em>really</em> get ahead in life by following what everyone else is already doing. (via <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/" target="_blank">merlin</a>)
