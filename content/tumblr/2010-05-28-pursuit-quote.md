<blockquote><p>Christopher Gardner: Hey. Don&#8217;t ever let somebody tell you&#8230; You can&#8217;t do something. Not even me. All right?</p>



<p>Christopher: All right. </p>



<p>Christopher Gardner: You got a dream&#8230; You gotta protect it. People can&#8217;t do somethin&#8217; themselves, they wanna tell you you can&#8217;t do it. If you want somethin&#8217;, go get it.</p></blockquote>&#8212;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0454921/quotes?qt0263689">The Pursuit of Happyness (2006) - Memorable quotes</a>
