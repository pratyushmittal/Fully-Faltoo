title: Turn off the router


<p>Want to respond to letters - complete the report - read a book -Â spend quality time with family?</p>

<p>Try turning off the router for an hour. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/" target="_blank">Handling impulsiveness is easy</a>, you just have to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Throw away the key: Close off tempting alternatives.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Setup a couple of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-z5kmVhzU" target="_blank">Pomodoros</a> to complete the job; or talk the matters with your complete presence. Don&#8217;t let your impulsiveness distract you! Your job will end up better and your clients will be happier.</p>

<p>Similar &#8220;tempting alternatives&#8221; might include: phone, television, tickers, IMs etc. When work starts expanding, turn these off - focus, and you can happily return to them after that.</p>
