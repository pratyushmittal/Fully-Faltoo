title: Steve Job's Resignation Letter


<blockquote>

<p>To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community:</p>

<p>I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet my duties and expectations as Apple’s CEO, I would be the first to let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come.</p>

<p>I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee. As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple. I believe Apple’s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a new role.</p>

<p>I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you.</p>

<p>Steve</p>
