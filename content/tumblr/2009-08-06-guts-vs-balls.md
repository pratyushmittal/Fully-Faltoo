<blockquote><font size="4"> We’ve all heard about people having Guts or Balls.<br/><br/>But do you really know the difference between them? In an effort to keep you informed, the definition for each is listed below&#160;:<br/><br/></font><font size="2"><font size="4"><u>GUTS</u> - is arriving home late after a night out with guys, being met by your wife with a broom, and having the guts to ask: “Are you still cleaning, or are you flying somewhere?”<br/><br/><u>BALLS</u> - is coming home late after a night out with the guys, smelling of perfume and beer, lipstick on your collar, slapping your wife on the ass and having the balls to say: “You’re next.”<br/><br/>    I hope this clears up any confusion on the definitions. Medically speaking, there is no difference in the outcome since both ultimately result in death.</font></font> <p style="font-size: 10px;"> <a href="http://posterous.com" target="_blank">Posted via email</a>  from <a href="http://nischal.posterous.com/guts-vs-balls" target="_blank">nischal’s posterous</a> | <a href="http://nischal.posterous.com/guts-vs-balls#comment" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 11px">Comment&#160;»</span></a> </p></blockquote>
