title: Writer's block


<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html" target="_blank">Seth Godin&#8217;s post yesterday on Talker&#8217;s Block</a> motivates me to give it a try. I haven&#8217;t been very good at writing and thus sometimes end up procrastinating jobs. Such as, after reading a good article, have often thought about writing an email to the author, but ended up procrastinating it to infinity.</p>

<p>This will be an interesting challenge to take-up and I will try to write some analysis, everyday single day, on the blog - beginning with this post!</p>

<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/09/talkers-block.html" target="_blank">Rules</a> are simple:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can write better.</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>

<p>Do it every day. Every single day. Not a diary, not fiction, but analysis. Clear, crisp, honest writing about what you see in the world. Or want to see. Or teach (in writing). Tell us how to do something.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thanks Seth!</p>

<p>[P.S.: Will also keep sharing other interesting things I stumble upon.]</p>
