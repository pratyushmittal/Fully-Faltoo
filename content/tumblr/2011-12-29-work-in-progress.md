<p>As a coder, it has always been a dream to develop my own blogging/CMS platform. Something where you can plug-in anything - anywhere.</p>

<p>I am finally moving from Tumblr to my own blogging platform. Though it is nowhere near to complete, releasing it would at-least keep me going. So here is the version One.Dot.O.</p>

<p>Stay tuned, lots and lots of interesting things are queued up!!!</p>

<p>[Going back to work :P].</p>
