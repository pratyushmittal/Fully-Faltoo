title: The Great Indian Magic!

<blockquote>Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. One from Bangladesh, another from India and the third, from China. They go with a White House official to examine the fence.<br/><br/>The Bangladesh contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil.<br/> “Well”, he says, “I figure the job will run about $900. ($400 for materials, $400 for my team and $100 profit for me)”.<br/><br/>The Chinese contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says,<br/> “I can do this job for $700. ($300 for materials, $300 for my team and $100 profit for me)”.<br/><br/>The Indian contractor doesn’t measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, “$2,700.”



The official, incredulous, says, “You didn’t even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?”<br/>The Indian contractor whispers back, “$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from China to fix the fence.”<br/><br/>“Done!” Replies the official.</blockquote>

<p>Hahahaha, Indians Rock!</p>
