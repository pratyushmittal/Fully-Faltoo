title: Taming your fears


<p>You can stay afraid forever of:</p>

<p>- a subject (taxation, particular disease, English grammar, politics),</p>

<p>- a term (SQL joints, standard deviation, VLOOKUP, Piotroski score),</p>

<p>- a method/framework (organisation manuals, guidance notes, new technology, Gmail, Linux), or</p>

<p>- an activity (swimming, public speaking, driving)</p>

<p>or get into its depth, learn about it, practice it and become its master. It might take some time and patience to learn something new (especially when you fear it), but you will soon realize that you have removed a bottleneck.</p>

<p>So start taming your fears!</p>
