<p>Men = eat + sleep + earn money<br/><br/>Pigs = eat + sleep<br/><br/>Hence, Men = Pigs + earn money<br/><br/>if Men - earn money = Pigs<br/><br/>in other words,<br/><br/>Men that don&#8217;t earn money = Pigs<br/><br/>**************<br/></p>

<p>Women = eat + sleep + spend<br/><br/>Pigs = eat + sleep<br/><br/>Hence, Women = Pigs + spend<br/><br/>if, Women - spend = Pigs<br/><br/>In other words,<br/><br/>Women that don&#8217;t spend = Pigs<br/><br/>**************</p>

<p><br/><b>Summary:</b><br/><br/>Men earn money not to let women become pigs!<br/><br/>Women spend not to let men become pigs!<br/><br/>Men + Women = 2 Pigs<br/><br/>Wish all the pigs happy forever.<br/><br/>**************</p>
