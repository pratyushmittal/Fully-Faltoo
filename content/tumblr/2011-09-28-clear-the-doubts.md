title: Clear the doubts


<p>As popularly said&#160;: if you ASSUME - you make an ASS of yoU and ME.</p>

<p>Whether it is about acceptable ID card, flight timing, dress code, location of somethingâ€¦ if you have even a slight doubt then it is better to confirm it. These things are few of those trifling ones but can cause high impact.</p>

<p>Save yourself from an embarrassment - clear your doubts!</p>
