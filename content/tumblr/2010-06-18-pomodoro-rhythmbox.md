<p><img src="http://a.yfrog.com/img526/2415/activatethealarmclock00.jpg"/></p>

<p>I recently <a target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/5554725/the-pomodoro-technique-trains-your-brain-away-from-distractions">read about the Pomodoro Technique at Lifehacker</a>. Simply put, it is to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Choose a task to be accomplished.</p>

<p>Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer).</p>

<p>Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thus it is to do <em><strong>&#8220;distraction free working in dashes&#8221;</strong></em>. 5 to 6 Pomodoros a day can help you achieve many goals/targets. Try it!!!</p>

<p><strong>Above pic is my favorite Pomodoro Timer [using Rhythmbox - Alarm Plugin on Ubuntu - Linux]. Others may try timers in mobile phones, or simply a start-stop watch.</strong></p>
