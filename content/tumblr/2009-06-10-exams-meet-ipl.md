<p><a href="http://santosh.gs/post/120958139/how-our-exams-would-be-if-the-ipl-took-over" target="_blank">santoshgs</a>:</p>



<blockquote>Cricket has reached exciting levels with IPL, infusing the same thing into exams, some suggestions:<br/><br/><br/><br/>1. Reduce exam duration to 1 hr and marks to 50.<br/><br/><br/><br/>2. Introduce strategic break after 30 minutes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>3. Give free hit, that is a chance for students to frame their own<br/><br/>questions and write answers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>4. 1st 15 minutes power play, that is no invigilator in the exam hall. (<br/><br/>everyone will love this….!!!)<br/><br/><br/><br/>5. Introduce fair play awards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>6. If any wrong question is asked you can give your own answer for the<br/><br/>next question ……………….FREE HIT………………..&#160;!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>And FINALLY:<br/><br/><br/>7. Cheer girls to cheer for every correct answer written….!!!</blockquote>



<p>I would love that :D&#160;!</p>
