<a href="http://toread.cc/">ToRead - An email-based "Read-It-Later" service</a><br/><p><strong>How often you stumble upon an interesting article and due to paucity of time unable to read it&#160;?</strong> For me it happens quite a few times and <em>till now</em> I ended up just adding it to bookmarks.</p>

<p><strong><em>ToRead is an awesome service and mails the complete article (along with source link) to your inbox.</em></strong></p>

<p>Give it a try!!!</p>
