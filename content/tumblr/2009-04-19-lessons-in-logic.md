<blockquote>

<p>If your father is a poor man, it is your fate;<br/>but, if your father-in-law is a poor man, it’s your stupidity.</p>

<p>I was born intelligent - Education ruined me.</p>

<p>Practice makes perfect.<br/> But nobody’s perfect……so why practice?</p>

<p>If it’s true that we are here to help others, then what exactly are the others here for?</p>

<p>Since light travels faster than sound, people appear bright until you hear them speak.</p>

<p>How come “abbreviated” is such a long word?</p>

<p>Money is not everything.<br/> There’s Mastercard &amp; Visa. [And there’s PayPal too.]</p>

<p>One should love animals.<br/> They are so tasty.</p>

<p>Behind every successful man, there is a woman<br/> And behind every unsuccessful man, there are two.</p>

<p>Every man should marry.<br/> After all, happiness is not the only thing in life.</p>

<p>The wise never marry.<br/>And when they marry they become otherwise.</p>

<p>Success is a relative term.<br/> It brings so many relatives.</p>

<p>Never put off the work till tomorrow what you can put off today.</p>

<p>“Your future depends on your dreams” So go to sleep.</p>

<p>There should be a better way to start a day than waking up every morning.</p>

<p>“Hard work never killed anybody”<br/> But why take the risk!</p>

<p>“Work fascinates me”<br/> I can look at it for hours.</p>

<p>God made relatives;<br/> Thank God we can choose our friends.</p>

<p>The more you learn, the more you know,<br/> The more you know, the more you forget<br/> The more you forget, the less you know<br/> So.. why learn?!</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 0 0 0 40px; border: none; padding: 0px;">A bus station is where a bus stops.<br/><br/>A train station is where a train stops.<br/><br/> On my desk, I have a work station….<br/>what more can I say……..</blockquote>

<p>Too many people spend money they haven’t earned, to buy things they don’t want, to impress people they don’t like.</p>

<p>Alcohol may be man’s worst enemy, but The Bible says love your enemy.</p>
