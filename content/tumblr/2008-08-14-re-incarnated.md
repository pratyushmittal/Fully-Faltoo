<p>The life was getting busy, and I was busy making it further more complicated. In the curiousity I had forgot the main purpose of Tumblr (it is <b><i>NOT</i> <i>BLOGGING</i></b> but <b>spreading the Tumblr Love</b>). It&#8217;s good that I soon realised that soon and got back on the track.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>What&#8217;s a tumblelog?</b></p>

<p>To make a simple analogy:  If blogs are journals,                             <b>tumblelogs are scrapbooks.</b></p>

<p>You can also look at tumblelogs as slightly more                             structured blogs that make it easier, faster,                             and more fun to post and share stuff you find or                             create.</p>

<p>So are you wondering where all my tech and internet posts have lost&#160;?</p>

<p>They have been dumped <b><a target="_blank" href="http://fully-faltoo.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</b></p>
