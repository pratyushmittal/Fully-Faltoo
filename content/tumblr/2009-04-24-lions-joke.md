title: Lion's Joke - hilarious


<p>One day Lion summons the other animals: “Each of you must tell a joke, but if any one fails to laugh, I’ll kill the one who told it. Monkey, go first.”</p>

<p>Monkey begins: “Two men are in the street and&#8230;.”</p>

<p>When he finishes, everyone bursts out laughing save Tortoise. “Tortoise didn’t laugh!” roars Lion, who pounces on Monkey and kills him.</p>

<p>“Elephant, you’re next.” The same thing happens again. Everyone is angry at Tortoise, but nobody dares move. “Now it’s Tiger’s turn.”</p>

<p>Tiger was about to begin when Tortoise falls over laughing. “What’s with you?” bellows Lion. “Tiger hasn’t told his joke yet&#8230;”</p>

<p>Tortoise replies: “Monkey’s joke is hilarious!”</p>
