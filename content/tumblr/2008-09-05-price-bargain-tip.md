title: Price bargain tip


<p>If you are the buyer, offer the salesperson 15 percent to 20 percent less than what you can really afford. &#8220;That way, you&#8217;ll be leaving room for concessions,&#8221; Larrick says. For instance, if you absolutely can&#8217;t spend more than $6,000 on a used car advertised at $7,000, try offering $5,100 (15 percent less than $6,000). Next: Explain why this price is reasonable (the car has a limited warranty or few of the extras you were hoping for). Reverse logic follows if you&#8217;re the seller: Make the initial price 15 percent more than what you&#8217;d accept — if you must get $6,000 for your car, offer it for around $7,000 — and have reasons why. Remember: Set a realistic limit and have a plan B if you don&#8217;t get a deal.</p>
