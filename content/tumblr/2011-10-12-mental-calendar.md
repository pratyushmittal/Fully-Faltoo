<blockquote>

<p>For any given month, all the multiples of 7 fall on the same day. I usually have memorized what day that is for the current month and the next few months. So October is a &#8220;[F]riday month&#8221; and November is a &#8220;Monday month&#8221; and December is a &#8220;Wednesday month&#8221;. You only have to memorize a new one every month.</p>

<p>Now when somebody says, &#8220;We should get together one Saturday. Say&#8230; December 12.&#8221; you can snap back with &#8220;That&#8217;s a Monday. Do you mean December 10?&#8221; All you have to do is find the nearest multiple of 7 and work from there. So when they ask about December 12, that&#8217;s close to December 14 - which must be a Wednesday (since December 2011 is a Wednesday month).</p>
