title: Recession quotes


<blockquote><p>When the president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce was asked recently how the depression had hit Los Angeles, he replied: &#8220;Depression? We have no depression in Los Angeles; but I will admit that we are having the worst boom in many years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8212;Christian Advocate</p>



<p>&#8220;A recession,&#8221; claimed a stockbroker, &#8220;is when your neighbor loses his job. A depression is when you lose your job. And panic is when your wife loses her job.&#8221;</p>
