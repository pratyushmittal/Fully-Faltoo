<img src="/static/tumblr_files/kLg0R7T3tgfk8pf6nMnuCaVVo1_500.jpg"/><br/><p>Just finished reading &#8220;The Ten Commandments of Business Failure&#8221;. It was a wonderful book and a must read for anyone. This short book (with 190 pages) covers everything with better quotes than in any quotes book.<br/>

The foreword is by Warren Buffett and praised by Bill Gates, I doubt you need more&#8230;</p>
