title: Online touch typing program


<a href="http://www.sense-lang.org/typing/">Online free touch typing program | keyboard</a><br/><p>I feel it is much better than keybr.com or typeracer.com as it has an option of typing your own text. Also it shows the fingers where there is an error, thus great for practicing the typing.</p>

<p>Please share your typing stats, mine was around 40-45 but still make a lot of errors :P.</p>
