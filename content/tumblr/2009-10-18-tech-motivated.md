<p>“11. Avoid Energy Vampires</p>

<p>Naysayers, pessimists, braggers they all are sucking up your energy. Don’t get caught in such power games, avoid at all costs those energy leaks. Even if that means you’ll isolate more often. It’s better to do work in your own secluded realm than to try to resist to a diminisihing environment.”</p>

<h3>&#8220;25. Keep A Clean Inbox</h3>

<p>That’s one of the few <a title="Staying GTD Over The Hype" target="_blank" href="http://www.dragosroua.com/staying-gtd-over-the-hype/">GTD concepts I still use</a> and it proves to be a great motivator. A clean inbox helps a smooth thoughts flow. A smooth thoughts flow let me be in the moment without any hidden burdens. Being in the moment is usually all I need to actually start doing things.&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Never thought about that before :P .</b></p>
