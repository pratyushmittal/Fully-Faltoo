title: Werewolf: A group game


I celebrated the new year on a vacation with a
group of friends. One of the best time-pass was
the group game of [Werewolf][werewolf].

Be it a bus journey, waiting at a stop or a late
night hangout on a beach, we played Werewolf
everywhere. It required only some chits of paper
(though we used a playing deck as a better
substitute).

It requires minimum 7 players and is best
experienced with 10-12 players.

I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a
large group, scope to shout, and time to go
through the rulebook.

**----Update on April 2015----**

I found the rules for another variation of this
game: [One Night Ultimate Werewolf][one-night].

[Mirror][mirror] of the above rule book.

I find this variation even better.
