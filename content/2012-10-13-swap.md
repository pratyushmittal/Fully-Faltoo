Title: How to add a swap partition
Date: 2014-10-13

I like to use [DigitalOcean][] for
trying out new web-applications and scripts. The
cheapest plan comes at $5/month but provides only
512MB of memory. Adding a 1Gb swap memory is
usually sufficient for temporary memory extensive
needs. These is a short documentation on how to
add the swap partition.

Adding a swap partition:

    sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=1024
    sudo mkswap /swap
    sudo swapon /swap

Making the partition persistent on system reboots:

    sudo vi /etc/fstab
    # Add a line to tell the system to use the file
    /swap   none    swap    sw  0   0

Optimize `swappiness` and `vfc_cache_pressure` *[for VPS needs][tutorial]*:

    sudo vi /etc/sysctl.conf
    # Add the following at the bottom
    vm.vfs_cache_pressure = 50
    vm.swappiness = 10

The detailed article about what each of the above
commands do is available [here][tutorial].
