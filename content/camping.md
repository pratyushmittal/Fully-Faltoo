I broke my phone and missed carrying a few items on my recent trek.
This is a short checklist for future references.

- Torch
- Pens
- Hand sanitizer
- Basic medicines
- Charge Kindle one night before
- Sleeping bag (also works as a pillow)
- Multi-tool (knife + cutter)
- Playing Cards + [Werewolf cards][werewolf]
- Lesser clothes
- Extra socks
- More lowers and less jeans
- Extra phone and an extra pair of spectacles
