Title: People to Avoid
Date: 2016-05-12

> “When I was very young, my father practiced law. One of his best friends, Grant McFayden was a client. He was a perfectly marvelous man of enormous charm and integrity - just a wonderful, wonderful man.
>
> In contrast, my father had another client who was a blowhard, overreaching, unfair, pompous, difficult man. And I must have been fourteen years old and thereabouts when I asked, “Dad, why do you do so much work for Mr. X - this overreaching blowhard - instead of working more for wonderful men like Grant McFayden?”
>
> My father said, “**Grant McFayden treats his employees right, his customers right and his problems right. And if he gets involved with a psychotic, he quickly walks over to where the psychotic is and works out an exit as fast as he can. Therefore, Grant McFayden doesn’t have enough remunerative law business. **But Mr. X is a walking minefield of wonderful legal business.”
>
> This case demonstrates one of the troubles with practicing law. To a considerable extent, you’re going to be dealing with grossly defective people. They create an enormous amount of the remunerative law business. And even when your own client is a paragon of virtue, you’ll often be dealing with gross defectives on the other side or even on the bench. That’s partly what drove me out of the profession.”
