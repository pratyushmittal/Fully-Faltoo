title: Triumph and Defeat - Atul Gawande
tags: "failure"

> “A failure often does not have to be a failure at all. However, you have to be ready for it. Will you admit when things go wrong? Will you take steps to set them right? Because the difference between triumph and defeat, you’ll find, isn’t about willingness to take risks. It’s about mastery of rescue.” – **Atul Gawande**, [2012 Williams College Commencement Address][complete]
