These are the websites I use the most based on my
browser's [frecency][frecency]:

*This post is inspired from [S Anand's blogpost][original].*

* A is for [amazon.in](http://www.amazon.in).
  Though I don't shop too much, I usually use
  Amazon to browse though books and
  read their initial pages.
* B is [bseindia.com](http://www.bseindia.com) - mostly
  for checking current stock prices and for
  keeping a track of latest corporate announcements.
* C shows one of my favorite tech blogs -
  [codinghorror.com](http://www.codinghorror.com).
  Recently, have been visiting it more frequently
  to check the blog's integration with
  [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org). It is followed by
  [cricket.yahoo.com](http://cricket.yahoo.com),
  which I use to keep a track of latest scores.
* D is [docs.google.com](http://docs.google.com).
  I love to use the live sharing and commenting
  feature in Google Docs to collaborate on
  articles, letters and reports. For other
  writings, I prefer to use gVim.
* E is
  [english.stackexchange.com](http://english.stackexchange.com).
  I recently read Strunk and White's
  [The Elements of Style][elements];
  have been using this StackExchange to follow up
  with few of the rules mentioned in the book.
* F is (obviously)
  [facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com). The
  runner-up is [feedly.com](http://feedly.com) - rss reader to keep
  a track of my favorite blogs. In future I would
  like to see Feedly climb above :).
* G is [github.com](http://www.github.com) - I
  love open-source projects.
* H is [hootsuite.com](http://hootsuite.com) - used to manage multiple
  Twitter accounts including
  [@faltoo](http://www.twitter.com/faltoo) and
  [@screener_in](http://www.twitter.com/screener_in).
* I is [irctc.co.in](http://www.irctc.co.in) -
  for booking all the train tickets. It is
  followed by [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com) for
  checking all the movie recommendations.
* J shows one of my favorite financial blogs
  [janav.wordpress.com](http://janav.wordpress.com).
  It is followed by [jpegmini.com](http://jpegmini.com),
  which I use to compress images in blog posts.
* K is [kickass.to](http://www.kickass.to) - for
  movies and music.
* L is [localhost](http://localhost/) - a
  playground for all my development projects.
* M is (again obviously)
  [mail.google.com](http://mail.google.com).
* N is
  [news.ycominator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com) -
  I use it to stay updated with the latest
  programing developments.
  Lately, I have been using more of
  [hckrnews.com](http://www.hckrnews.com) for its
  better interface.
* O is
  [openshift.redhat.com](http://openshift.redhat.com) -
  for deploying new test projects for free.
* P is
  [play.fully-faltoo.com](http://play.fully-faltoo.com)
  - a custom domain used for testing different
  internal projects at different times. It is
  followed by
  [pixlr.com/express/](http://pixlr.com/express/),
  used for quickly fixing the photographs.
* Q is [Quora](http://www.quora.com). I am not a
  huge fan of Quora but it is the only one with Q.
* R is [Readiot.com](http://www.readiotbox.com) -
  a side-project I have been working upon. It is
  like Evernote but saves everything in your
  DropBox.
* S is for [screener.in](http://www.screener.in) -
  the project that takes most of my time :). It is
  followed by [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com) -
  my favorite resource to get and provide help.
* T is [twitter.com](http://www.twitter.com) - I
  like to keep track of latest updates through
  Twitter rather than watching news.
* U is [ubuntu.com](http://ubuntu.com/), an old
  and the only item in U. Now I like to use
  [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/).
* V is [valuepickr.com](http://valuepickr.com/),
  my favorite forum for in-depth discussions on stocks.
* W is [webfaction.com](http://webfaction.com) -
  my webhost for all the production deployments.
* X is [xiaomi.eu](http://xiaomi.eu/community/) -
  an old one time item when I used MIUI Rom on my
  Nexus S.
* Y is [youtube.com](http://youtube.com) - I love
  to hear music and watch my favorite channels
  online.
* Z has no items.
