[This][zero] is a powerful guide to Zero-Inbox technique using Gmail shortcuts.

`e`: archive  
`#`: delete  
`se`: star & archive  
`gi`: goto inbox  
`gs`: goto stared mails (do more often than `gi`)  
`j`: next mail  
`k`: previous mail

While reading the [discussion][] about it, also came across some useful Gmail tips:

1. Use [followup.cc][].
2. Enable [auto-advance][] in labs.
3. Enable [undo sent][] if you already haven't.
