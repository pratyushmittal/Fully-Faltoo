I attended [Pycon India][pycon] during last couple
of days. As always, it felt great to meet so many
smart programmers creating amazing things. These
are my notes from various workshops, talks and
interactions [^Note].

In an interaction with [@Gaurav][gaurav], he
mentioned about [Behave library][behave] - "it is
for behaviour-driven development. It is so
intuitive that even a non techy person can write
specs for your code." The concept sounds
interesting for writing browser tests with
Selenium.

[@Shashank][shashank] gave a workshop on "scraping
even the hardest websites." Though I have used
BeautifulSoup [^Soup] before, using Selenium with
[PhantomJS][] was a new learning. Another interesting note
from the talk was using
[DeathByCaptcha][deathbycaptcha] API for solving
captchas on websites.

So now my workflow for scraping websites is
something like this:

<dl>
    <dt>Traditional GET requests</dt>
    <dd>Requests.</dd>

    <dt>Forms / POST requests</dt>
    <dd><a href="https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser">RoboBrowser</a>
    (to go around CSRF and ASP websites).</dd>

    <dt>Modern single-page-websites</dt>
    <dd>It probably has REST APIs - use them.</dd>

    <dt>For other Javascript heavy websites</dt>
    <dd>Selenium + PhantomJS.</dd>
</dl>

In another workshop, [@Anand][anand] not only
explained us how decorators work, but also
made us do lots of exercises. One can [go
through the notebook here][decorators]. By the end
of the workshop we learned to write our own trace,
memorize / cache and routing decorators.

Apart from decorators, I also learned about
various magic commands in IPython Notebook:

    %%file filename.py
    # Python Code
    # below it will save the code
    # in the given filename

    !python filename.py
    # using ! we can run bash-commands

    %magic
    # To see all the available magic commands in IPython
    # (found in an interaction with Eswar Vandanapu)

[@Kushal][kushal] gave a keynote on the importance
of contributing upstream. By going through the
source codes of our favorite programs, we can not
only become a better programmer but also get an
opportunity to contribute to it. I pledge to have
a closer look at the source codes of two of my
favorite Python packages - Rhythmbox and Django.

Guys from IIT Bhu talked about using
[SimpleCV][simplecv] to play flappy-birds using
gestures. The library looks quite powerful to do
some interesting stuff with cameras and images. I
have a few toy-ideas in my mind now [^SimpleCV Ideas]
- will see how they go.

[@Kiran][kiran] shared the problems he faced while
creating [LastUser][] service. I learned about
database-backed sessions and about how they differ
from cookie based sessions. Kiran also emphasized
on using HTTPS by showing how easy it was to
hijack sessions using FireSheep on an unsecured
network.

Django uses database-backed sessions by default.
While digging into the [related documentation][django], I
found the solution to some of my problems
[^sessions].

Second keynote speaker, [@Michael Foord][foord],
emphasized on moving the projects from
platform-as-a-service (such as Heroku other such
hostings) to infrastructure-as-a-service (such as
Amazon AWS). The hosting services should be
considered as livestock or sheeps instead of as
pets. They should be easily migratable and
redeployable whenever needed. Docker and JuJu are
steps towards that.

[@S Anand][s anand] presented a talk on "faster
data processing in python." He began with basic
pieces of codes and then optimized them
incrementally - explaining the measurement
techniques and conceptual approach towards
optimization. The [complete talk][video] can be viewed
online, while the [notebook is available here][faster].

Few important libraries mentioned in the talk
were:

<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler">line_profiler</a></dt>
    <dd>Shows the number of hits and time spent on
    each <i>line of code</i>.</dd>

    <dt>Pandas and Numpy</dt>
    <dd>For performing vector operations.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> @jit decorator</dt>
    <dd>Converts a Python function to efficient machine instruction.</dd>
</dl>

During the lightning talks, [@Vineet][vineet] showcased his
library [Pipdeptree][pipdeptree], which displays all the pip
dependencies in a tree format. It will surely come
quite handy for generating sane `requirements.txt`.

[@Ankur][ankur] showcased his awesome new project
[ImportPython.com][importpython] - a *customized*
Python weekly newsletter. Apart from that, the
website lists all the Python books (free as well
as paid) categorized by reader's levels. In future
he plans to bring everything else, including
videos, presentations etc. related to Python at
one place.

Together, this is a long list of new libraries and
concepts to try-out and practice. It should keep
me busy well until the next PyCon.



<!--- foot-notes -->

[^Note]: **Note:** This is *not a post about
everything* interesting that happened at the
event. There were many other interesting talks and
workshops. These are only the things I noted down
during the event to implement them in my projects
at sometime.

[^Soup]: I prefer to use `lxml` with [PyQuery][pyquery]
for parsing and selecting the elements.

[^SimpleCV Ideas]: **Toy-ideas:**
1. Write a script to take images each time I open
   the lid of laptop.
2. Write a script to automatically filter the
   best, find duplicates, and fix images from a
   large album.

[^sessions]: In a database-backed session, a
session row is created in the database on each
user login. The encrypted id of this row is stored
in the user's cookie. On each `is_authenticated()`
call, this session row is fetched. Thus this can be
used to store session data of any size without
incurring any additional overhead - example use
cases: storing user's votes, alerts, carts,
trackers etc to show "already voted or item
present in cart" flags.
