Hi, I am Pratyush. I am a Chartered Accountant but I also love to write computer programs.

I am currently digging deep into the principals of value investing and also developing a financial tool called [Screener][].

Follow me on [Twitter][] or [Github][].

## Stocks and Finance

I assist my brother and dad in analyzing stocks.
Together we share our ideas on [Dalal-Street blog][blog].

I try to follow the principles of [Benjamin Graham][graham]
while valuing companies.

Sometime in 2008, I wrote a few scripts to screen
the stocks and analyze individual companies quickly. Over the years, the project has developed into a much better form of a web-app called [Screener][].


## Programming

I love to learn and try new web technologies,
libraries and frameworks. I currently use Python
and Django for most of my projects.

I have an Arch Linux installation, with VIM text
editor and i3 tiling window manager.
