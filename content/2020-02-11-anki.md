title: Anki - a software to learning anything
status: draft

One of the best software I stumbled upon last year was Anki.

Anki is software to learn anything using spaced repetition. Doctors use it remember medicines and linguists use it to learn new languages. I use it to remember new concepts and facts.

[Pic of an example]()

I have created 4 decks:
- Geography: using the sample deck
- Life hacks: any new concept
- Industry facts: facts related to various industries.
- Word meanings: meanings of words which are new

Usual workflow:
- I read a book
- Summarise notes 
- Reminder at 2pm everyday to complete Anki

Advantages:
