**Don't Be Afraid, You Can Do It! - by Steve Jobs**  
    - Circuit Board  
    - Boot time  
    - Gorilla Glass  

**Simplicity!**  
    - iPod: 3 Clicks, any song  
    - Focus: Made list of everything, then took-up top 3  

**Passion for curiosity!**  
    - Einstein's Compass  

**Be Tolerant, Humility/Pretence of humility (by listening to others)**  
    - We tend to be wrong. So listen to others to came to a common ground.  

**Thinking Different / Imagination and Giving Back**  
    - Being larger than life
    - Job's spirit of creation
    - Einstein's last equation
    - Franklin's document to listen to others

**They too were just the like us, just the flesh and blood people**  
    - They too made mistakes
