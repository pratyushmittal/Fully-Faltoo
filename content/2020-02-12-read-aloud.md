title: Enabling speech on Mac
tags: mac

Know the secret of writing well? Read out aloud.

Mac has a feature to read out any selected text. We can enable it by:<br>
Going to system preferences >> Accessibility >> Speech >> Speak selected text with shortcut

![Enable speech on Mac]({static}/uploads/enable-speech.png)


I use the default shortcut: Option + Esc.<br>
Same panel also provides the option to select voice and read speed.

Now select any text and press the shortcut to read it out.
