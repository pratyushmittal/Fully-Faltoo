Nathan discusses why it is important to have multiple price points.

> If I tell you the book is $39, you need to compare the value to something else, something which I donâ€™t have control over. But if I tell you the book is $39, but for $79 you can buy the book plus all these great videos and code samples, then you are comparing the two packages to each other. All of a sudden $39 sounds reasonable, and you are trying to decide if the extra value in the $79 package justifies the price increase.
