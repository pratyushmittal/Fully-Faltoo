title: Using Anki to learn new things: examples and tips
date: 2020-04-11
status: draft

I love to learn new ideas. I read books, follow blogs, watch presentations and write notes, but everything I learn starts to erase from memory after few days.

**[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/)** helps me remember these new ideas through "spaced-repetition". It asks questions at repeated intervals. The interval increases as the new ideas become permanent in memory.

**Example of how spaced repetition works:**<br>
1st review: after 1 day<br>
2nd review: after 1 week<br>
3rd review: after 1 month<br>
4th review: after 3 months<br>
5th review: after 6 months<br>

## Example of notes

I file my notes under 3 decks:
<br>1. Industrial facts
<br>2. Life hacks
<br>3. New words and concepts

### Industrial notes

Questions around numbers and information that helps me visualize various businesses.

## Tips to use Anki

- If you are new to Anki, start with a [shared deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) such as [states in your Country](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2806889860). It will give you an idea about how Anki works.
- ["Cloze" notes](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/editing?id=cloze-deletion), ie. fill-in-the-blanks styles notes, are easier to recall and also more fun to answer
- Include a picture or screenshot of the reference material for remembering the context. I include pictures in the *extra* section.
- Set a repeat reminder in your calender to do Anki everyday.
- Try to add new cards everyday.
- Bookmark [Anki's web-interface](https://ankiuser.net/edit/) to add new cards. It comes handy for creating new cards while browsing.


Creating notes are helpful because we are able to connect dots when we remember the things we learn.

I have set a repeat-reminder to "Do Anki" after lunch everyday at 2pm. It takes less than two minutes and has proved to be one of the most valuable life-hacks.
