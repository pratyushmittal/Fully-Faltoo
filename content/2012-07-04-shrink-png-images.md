Have already been a [fan of JpegMini][1] and now comes TinyPNG. Many times it indeed happened that I converted a PNG to JPEG just to then minimize it using jpeg mini.

But what I liked the most about TinyPNG was:

> Internet Explorer 6 normally ignores PNG transparency and displays a solid background colour. With TinyPNG the background becomes transparent again. No workarounds!
