Some nice tricks to improve your searches on Google. I didn't know about some of these power-symbols like:

> `~review` to include related words, such as “check, examine, opinion”.
>
> `* distribution` to replaces itself with common terms in your search.
>
> `2010..2012` - Shows all results from within the specified time-range.
>
> `$100..$200` - gives you results based on a range from $100 to $200.
