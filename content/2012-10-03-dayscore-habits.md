This is wow! Earlier I used to make a [score list of daily rituals][1] to get the important (and un-motivating) things done. [DayScore][2] converts that concept into an awesome web platform to "reinforce positive habits by keeping score."

I have set the service as one of my opening tabs in Chrome.
