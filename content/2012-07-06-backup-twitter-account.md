> twDocs lets you save Twitter tweets and search results as PDF, DOC, XML, CSV, TXT, XLS or HTML files. You can also use it to backup your direct messages!

This is awesome, I sometimes need to search into my Tweets and TwDocs makes it very easy.

I am also using IFTTT along with it to maintain updates automatically after the first time.
