Title: Visiting China - Tips

Last week, I visited Shenzhen in China with my
family for 3 days. Shenzhen is a shopping paradise
with huge markets such as Dongmen and Lo Wu
commercial center. Shenzhen is surrounded by
hills, which give it a pleasant weather all the
year round.

I compare my visit to China to that of some alien
world, where the habitants have progressed as
much as us (or even more), but where they don't
understand our language, they don't accept our
credit cards and where we can't use your mobile
applications.

These are few of the things I noted for our next
trip to China.


**Things to note before visiting China:**

- Google is banned in China. So is Facebook and
  Twitter.
- Since Google is banned, we cannot use Android
  Play Store, Google Maps or Gmail.
- Credit Cards (our was International MasterCard)
  might not work in China.
- Sim cards from Hong Kong might not provide
  internet access.
- WhatsApp and WeChat work. So does iPhone.


**Workarounds and preparations:**

- Pre-install [Baidu Translate][baidu] for text
  translation and voice translation.
- Download offline package in Baidu Translate:
  There is an option in the app to download the
  offline package so that the translation works
  even when there is no internet.
- Use Uber: Ensure to change your mobile number in
  the profile option. The driver will probably
  call you before coming. Have someone else tell
  your current position in that case.
- Print out locations in Chinese names (especially
  your address of stay): It is helpful to get
  someone to write down the Chinese names of
  locations you wish to go to.
- Bring sufficient RMB (Chinese Yuan Renminbi):
  Since credit cards might not work in China, it
  is better to carry sufficient RMB. We found the
  best conversion rates in Tsim Tsa Tsui (in Hong
  Kong) market (*don't* use Western Union).
- Print the emails: Since Gmail wont
  work in China, it is better to print or download
  important emails before arrival.
- Use AirBnB: We booked our stay through
  [AirBnB][airbnb]. The host was extremely
  co-operative and always available over WhatsApp.
  It is good to have some local person to rely on.
- Buy a sim-card soon: The sim costs around RMB 70 with
  the data pack. It is a helpful to have it early.

**Enjoy your trip to China.**
