Very often we under-appreciate the acts of the illusionists and the Magicians.

Until I watched the movie [The Wrestler](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1125849/), I never really understood the pain really taken by the wrestlers to entertain us, even if the act itself is scripted.

Similarly with this video. I myself love to perform card-tricks and am a huge fan of illusions. With the above video, I respect David Blaine even more.
