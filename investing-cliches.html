</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Some interesting ones from the page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a Black Swan event/Perfect Storm = I didn’t read that book but I did watch the George Clooney movie and I learned that you can’t ever blame me for mismanaging your money</p>
<p>Buy the rumor, sell the news = The only cliche on this list older than Warren Buffett; buy something as soon as you hear something might happen, sell it when the company confirms it’s happening</p>
<p>It passed our sniff-test = I asked another fund manager if he liked it. He said, yes.</p>
<p>The earnings were a mixed bag / had something for everyone = There’s not much to discuss here but I’m going to kill a few minutes before the next guest arrives</p>
<p>Gold is a hard asset that stores value = Buy Gold!</p>
<p>Gold is a yellow rock with no value = Sell Gold!</p>
<p>This time it’s different because = Get ready for some pretty wild-eyed crazy logic….</p>
<p>Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent = This sounds better than “put this in your pipe and smoke it”</p>
<p>The easiest way to make $1 million on a trade is to start with $2 million = Hey, none of us knows what he/she is doing here, but we can all laugh at this one… just as long as we’re not the ones at the losing end of this trade</p>
<p>[Stock XYZ] wants higher…./is resting…/is ripping… = Fancy ways of saying my stock is not going up enough</p>
<p>We like big-cap healthcare here = Don’t ask me to give you any specific stock names I like – I just say this because I don’t have any real ideas</p>
