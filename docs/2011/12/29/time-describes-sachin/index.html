      <blockquote>

<p>“ When Sachin Tendulkar travelled to Pakistan to face one of the finest bowling attacks ever assembled in cricket, Michael Schumacher was yet to race a F1 car, Lance Armstrong had never been to the Tour de France, Diego Maradona was still the captain of a world champion Argentina team, Pete Sampras had never won a Grand&nbsp;Slam.</p>

<p>When Tendulkar embarked on a glorious career taming Imran and company, Roger Federer was a name unheard of; Lionel Messi was in his nappies, Usain Bolt was an unknown kid in the Jamaican backwaters. The Berlin Wall was still intact, <span class="caps">USSR</span> was one big, big country, Dr Manmohan Singh was yet to &#8220;open&#8221; the Nehruvian&nbsp;economy.</p>

<p>It seems while Time was having his toll on every individual on the face of this planet, he excused one man. Time stands frozen in front of Sachin Tendulkar. We have had champions, we have had legends, but we have never had another Sachin Tendulkar and we never&nbsp;will.”  </p>

<p>Though I couldn&#8217;t trace it in <span class="caps">TIME</span>&#8217;s archives, it inspires none the&nbsp;less. </p>
