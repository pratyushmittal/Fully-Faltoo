      <p>Last week, I visited Shenzhen in China with my
family for 3 days. Shenzhen is a shopping paradise
with huge markets such as Dongmen and Lo Wu
commercial center. Shenzhen is surrounded by
hills, which give it a pleasant weather all the
year&nbsp;round.</p>
<p>I compare my visit to China to that of some alien
world, where the habitants have progressed as
much as us (or even more), but where they don&#8217;t
understand our language, they don&#8217;t accept our
credit cards and where we can&#8217;t use our mobile&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>These are few of the things I noted for our next
trip to&nbsp;China.</p>
<p><strong>Things to note before visiting&nbsp;China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google is banned in China. So is Facebook and&nbsp;Twitter.</li>
<li>Since Google is banned, we cannot use Android
  Play Store, Google Maps or&nbsp;Gmail.</li>
<li>Credit Cards (our was International MasterCard)
  might not work in&nbsp;China.</li>
<li>Sim cards from Hong Kong might not provide
  internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li>WhatsApp and WeChat work. So does&nbsp;iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workarounds and&nbsp;preparations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baidu.baidutranslate&amp;hl=en">Baidu Translate</a> for text
  translation and voice&nbsp;translation.</li>
<li>Download offline package in Baidu Translate:
  There is an option in the app to download the
  offline package so that the translation works
  even when there is no&nbsp;internet.</li>
<li>Use Uber: Ensure to change your mobile number in
  the profile option. The driver will probably
  call you before coming. Have someone else tell
  your current position in that&nbsp;case.</li>
<li>Print out locations in Chinese names (especially
  your address of stay): It is helpful to get
  someone to write down the Chinese names of
  locations you wish to go&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>Bring sufficient <span class="caps">RMB</span> (Chinese Yuan Renminbi):
  Since credit cards might not work in China, it
  is better to carry sufficient <span class="caps">RMB</span>. We found the
  best conversion rates in Tsim Tsa Tsui (in Hong
  Kong) market (<em>don&#8217;t</em> use Western&nbsp;Union).</li>
<li>Print the emails: Since Gmail wont
  work in China, it is better to print or download
  important emails before&nbsp;arrival.</li>
<li>Use AirBnB: We booked our stay through
  <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/2910033">AirBnB</a>. The host was extremely
  co-operative and always available over WhatsApp.
  It is good to have some local person to rely&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Buy a sim-card soon: The sim costs around <span class="caps">RMB</span> 70 with
  the data pack. It is a helpful to have it&nbsp;early.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enjoy your trip to&nbsp;China.</strong></p>
