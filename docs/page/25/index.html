<blockquote>Three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the White House. One from Bangladesh, another from India and the third, from China. They go with a White House official to examine the fence.<br/><br/>The Bangladesh contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil.<br/> “Well”, he says, “I figure the job will run about $900. ($400 for materials, $400 for my team and $100 profit for me)”.<br/><br/>The Chinese contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says,<br/> “I can do this job for $700. ($300 for materials, $300 for my team and $100 profit for me)”.<br/><br/>The Indian contractor doesn’t measure or figure, but leans over to the White House official and whispers, “$2,700.”



The official, incredulous, says, “You didn’t even measure like the other guys! How did you come up with such a high figure?”<br/>The Indian contractor whispers back, “$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from China to fix the fence.”<br/><br/>“Done!” Replies the official.</blockquote>

<p>(This is reportedly based on an actual experiment conducted in the U.K.)<br/><br/><i>Put eight monkeys in a room. In the middle of the room is a ladder, leading to a bunch of bananas hanging from a hook on the ceiling.<br/><br/> Each time a monkey tries to climb the ladder, all the monkeys are sprayed with ice water, which makes them miserable. Soon enough, whenever a monkey attempts to climb the ladder, all of the other monkeys, not wanting to be sprayed, set upon him and beat him up. Soon, none of the eight monkeys ever attempts to climb the ladder.<br/><br/> One of the original monkeys is then removed, and a new monkey is put in the room. Seeing the bananas and the ladder, he wonders why none of the other monkeys are doing the obvious. But undaunted, he immediately begins to climb the ladder.<br/><br/> All the other monkeys fall upon him and beat him silly. He has no idea why.<br/><br/> However, he no longer attempts to climb the ladder.<br/><br/> A second original monkey is removed and replaced. The newcomer again attempts to climb the ladder, but all the other monkeys hammer the crap out of him.<br/><br/> This includes the previous new monkey, who, grateful that he’s not on the receiving end this time, participates in the beating because all the other monkeys are doing it. However, he has no idea why he’s attacking the new monkey.<br/><br/><br/> One by one, all the original monkeys are replaced. Eight new monkeys are now in the room. None of them have ever been sprayed by ice water. None of them attempt to climb the ladder. All of them will enthusiastically beat up any new monkey who tries, without having any idea&nbsp;why.</i></p>
