<p>I attended <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2014/">Pycon India</a> during last couple
of days. As always, it felt great to meet so many
smart programmers creating amazing things. These
are my notes from various workshops, talks and
interactions <sup id="fnref:Note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Note">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an interaction with <a href="https://twitter.com/gvrv">@Gaurav</a>, he
mentioned about <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/behave/">Behave library</a> - &#8220;it is
for behaviour-driven development. It is so
intuitive that even a non techy person can write
specs for your code.&#8221; The concept sounds
interesting for writing browser tests with&nbsp;Selenium.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/shshank">@Shashank</a> gave a workshop on &#8220;scraping
even the hardest websites.&#8221; Though I have used
BeautifulSoup <sup id="fnref:Soup"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Soup">2</a></sup> before, using Selenium with
<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> was a new learning. Another interesting note
from the talk was using
<a href="http://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">DeathByCaptcha</a> <span class="caps">API</span> for solving
captchas on&nbsp;websites.</p>
<p>So now my workflow for scraping websites is
something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Traditional <span class="caps">GET</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd>Requests.</dd>

    <dt>Forms / <span class="caps">POST</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd><a href="https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser">RoboBrowser</a>
    (to go around <span class="caps">CSRF</span> and <span class="caps">ASP</span>&nbsp;websites).</dd>

    <dt>Modern&nbsp;single-page-websites</dt>
    <dd>It probably has <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs - use&nbsp;them.</dd>

    <dt>For other Javascript heavy&nbsp;websites</dt>
    <dd>Selenium +&nbsp;PhantomJS.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In another workshop, <a href="https://twitter.com/anandology">@Anand</a> not only
explained us how decorators work, but also
made us do lots of exercises. One can <a href="http://anandology.com/nb/2014/decorators-demystified/">go
through the notebook here</a>. By the end
of the workshop we learned to write our own trace,
memorize / cache and routing&nbsp;decorators.</p>
<p>Apart from decorators, I also learned about
various magic commands in IPython&nbsp;Notebook:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">%</span><span class="nf">%file</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="cp"># Python Code</span>
<span class="cp"># below it will save the code</span>
<span class="cp"># in the given filename</span>

<span class="o">!</span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="cp"># using ! we can run bash-commands</span>

<span class="nf">%magic</span>
<span class="cp"># To see all the available magic commands in IPython</span>
<span class="cp"># (found in an interaction with Eswar Vandanapu)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kushaldas">@Kushal</a> gave a keynote on the importance
of contributing upstream. By going through the
source codes of our favorite programs, we can not
only become a better programmer but also get an
opportunity to contribute to them. I pledge to have
a closer look at the source codes of two of my
favorite Python packages - Rhythmbox and&nbsp;Django.</p>
<p>Guys from <span class="caps">IIT</span> Bhu talked about using
<a href="http://simplecv.org/">SimpleCV</a> to play flappy-birds using
gestures. The library looks quite powerful to do
some interesting stuff with cameras and images. I
have a few toy-ideas in my mind now <sup id="fnref:SimpleCV Ideas"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SimpleCV Ideas">3</a></sup>
- will see how they&nbsp;go.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jace">@Kiran</a> shared the problems he faced while
creating <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">LastUser</a> service. I learned about
database-backed sessions and about how they differ
from cookie based sessions. Kiran also emphasized
on using <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> by showing how easy it was to
hijack sessions using FireSheep on an unsecured&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Django uses database-backed sessions by default.
While digging into the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/sessions/">related documentation</a>, I
found the solution to some of my problems
<sup id="fnref:sessions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sessions">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Second keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cv.shtml">@Michael Foord</a>,
emphasized on moving the projects from
platform-as-a-service (such as Heroku other such
hostings) to infrastructure-as-a-service (such as
Amazon <span class="caps">AWS</span>). A hosting service should be
considered as livestock or sheep instead of as
pet. It should be easily migratable and
redeployable whenever needed. Docker and JuJu are
steps towards&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sanand0">@S Anand</a> presented a talk on &#8220;faster
data processing in python.&#8221; He began with basic
pieces of codes and then optimized them
incrementally - explaining the measurement
techniques and conceptual approach towards
optimization. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM-SgJTi8g0#t=14970">complete talk</a> can be viewed
online, while the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Faster%20Data%20Processing%20in%20Python.ipynb">notebook is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Few important libraries mentioned in the talk&nbsp;were:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler">line_profiler</a></dt>
    <dd>Shows the number of hits and time spent on
    each <i>line of code</i>.</dd>

    <dt>Pandas and&nbsp;Numpy</dt>
    <dd>For performing vector&nbsp;operations.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> @jit&nbsp;decorator</dt>
    <dd>Converts a Python function to efficient machine&nbsp;instruction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>During the lightning talks, <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin">@Vineet</a> showcased his
library <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree">Pipdeptree</a>, which displays all the pip
dependencies in a tree format. It will surely come
quite handy for generating sane <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/originalankur">@Ankur</a> showcased his awesome new project
<a href="http://importpython.com/">ImportPython.com</a> - a <em>customized</em>
Python weekly newsletter. Apart from that, the
website lists all the Python books (free as well
as paid) categorized by reader&#8217;s levels. In future
he plans to bring everything else, including
videos, presentations etc. related to Python at
one&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Together, this is a long list of new libraries and
concepts to try-out and practice. It should keep
me busy well until the next&nbsp;PyCon.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is <em>not a post about
everything</em> interesting that happened at the
event. There were many other interesting talks and
workshops. These are only the things I noted down
during the event to implement them in my projects
at sometime.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:Soup">
<p>I prefer to use <code>lxml</code> with <a href="https://github.com/gawel/pyquery/">PyQuery</a>
for parsing and selecting the elements.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Soup" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:SimpleCV Ideas">
<p><strong>Toy-ideas:</strong>
1. Write a script to take images each time I open
   the lid of laptop.
2. Write a script to automatically filter the
   best, find duplicates, and fix images from a
   large album.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:SimpleCV Ideas" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:sessions">
<p>In a database-backed session, a
session row is created in the database on each
user login. The encrypted id of this row is stored
in the user&#8217;s cookie. On each <code>is_authenticated()</code>
call, this session row is fetched. Thus this can be
used to store session data of any size without
incurring any additional overhead - example use
cases: storing user&#8217;s votes, alerts, carts,
trackers etc to show &#8220;already voted or item
present in cart&#8221; flags.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sessions" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
