      <p>1. “My first job is to say thank you to those who voted me. Those who didn’t, I’m going to get your vote next&nbsp;time.”</p>

<p>2. “My job is not to represent Washington to you, but to represent you to&nbsp;Washington.”</p>

<p>3. “We’re not going to baby sit a civil&nbsp;war.”</p>

<p>4. “There’s not a liberal America and a conservative America - there’s the United States of&nbsp;America.”</p>

<p>5. “In the end, that’s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of&nbsp;hope?”</p>

<p>6. “I’m so overexposed, I’m making Paris Hilton look like a&nbsp;recluse.”</p>

<p>7. “If you’re walking down the right path and you’re willing to keep walking, eventually you’ll make&nbsp;progress.”</p>

<p>8. “My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to&nbsp;success.”</p>

<p>9. “No one is&nbsp;pro-abortion.”</p>

<p>10. “The Bush Administration’s failure to be consistently involved in helping Israel achieve peace with the Palestinians has been both wrong for our friendship with Israel, as well as badly damaging to our standing in the Arab&nbsp;world.”</p>

<p>11. “Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation - not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years&nbsp;ago.”</p>

<p>12. “Because hope is not blind&nbsp;optimism.”</p>

<p>13. “Because nothing worthwhile in this country has ever happened unless somebody, somewhere stood up when it was hard; stood up when they were told – no you can’t, and said yes we&nbsp;can.”</p>

<p>14. “We have an obligation and a responsibility to be investing in our students and our schools. We must make sure that people who have the grades, the desire and the will, but not the money, can still get the best education&nbsp;possible.”</p>

<p>15. ”It’s been a great ride. But I know how quickly these fads can pass. You all remember the pet rock, the mood ring, Howard&nbsp;Dean.”</p>
