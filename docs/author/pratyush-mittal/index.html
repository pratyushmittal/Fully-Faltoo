      <blockquote>
<p>“When I was very young, my father practiced law. One of his best friends, Grant McFayden was a client. He was a perfectly marvelous man of enormous charm and integrity - just a wonderful, wonderful&nbsp;man.</p>
<p>In contrast, my father had another client who was a blowhard, overreaching, unfair, pompous, difficult man. And I must have been fourteen years old and thereabouts when I asked, “Dad, why do you do so much work for Mr. X - this overreaching blowhard - instead of working more for wonderful men like Grant&nbsp;McFayden?”</p>
<p>My father said, “<strong>Grant McFayden treats his employees right, his customers right and his problems right. And if he gets involved with a psychotic, he quickly walks over to where the psychotic is and works out an exit as fast as he can. Therefore, Grant McFayden doesn’t have enough remunerative law business. </strong>But Mr. X is a walking minefield of wonderful legal&nbsp;business.”</p>
<p>This case demonstrates one of the troubles with practicing law. To a considerable extent, you’re going to be dealing with grossly defective people. They create an enormous amount of the remunerative law business. And even when your own client is a paragon of virtue, you’ll often be dealing with gross defectives on the other side or even on the bench. That’s partly what drove me out of the&nbsp;profession.”</p>

        <a href="https://fully-faltoo.com/2015/04/07/china/">Visiting China -&nbsp;Tips</a>
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post">
      <p>Last week, I visited Shenzhen in China with my
family for 3 days. Shenzhen is a shopping paradise
with huge markets such as Dongmen and Lo Wu
commercial center. Shenzhen is surrounded by
hills, which give it a pleasant weather all the
year&nbsp;round.</p>
<p>I compare my visit to China to that of some alien
world, where the habitants have progressed as
much as us (or even more), but where they don&#8217;t
understand our language, they don&#8217;t accept our
credit cards and where we can&#8217;t use our mobile&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>These are few of the things I noted for our next
trip to&nbsp;China.</p>
<p><strong>Things to note before visiting&nbsp;China:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google is banned in China. So is Facebook and&nbsp;Twitter.</li>
<li>Since Google is banned, we cannot use Android
  Play Store, Google Maps or&nbsp;Gmail.</li>
<li>Credit Cards (our was International MasterCard)
  might not work in&nbsp;China.</li>
<li>Sim cards from Hong Kong might not provide
  internet&nbsp;access.</li>
<li>WhatsApp and WeChat work. So does&nbsp;iPhone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Workarounds and&nbsp;preparations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-install <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baidu.baidutranslate&amp;hl=en">Baidu Translate</a> for text
  translation and voice&nbsp;translation.</li>
<li>Download offline package in Baidu Translate:
  There is an option in the app to download the
  offline package so that the translation works
  even when there is no&nbsp;internet.</li>
<li>Use Uber: Ensure to change your mobile number in
  the profile option. The driver will probably
  call you before coming. Have someone else tell
  your current position in that&nbsp;case.</li>
<li>Print out locations in Chinese names (especially
  your address of stay): It is helpful to get
  someone to write down the Chinese names of
  locations you wish to go&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>Bring sufficient <span class="caps">RMB</span> (Chinese Yuan Renminbi):
  Since credit cards might not work in China, it
  is better to carry sufficient <span class="caps">RMB</span>. We found the
  best conversion rates in Tsim Tsa Tsui (in Hong
  Kong) market (<em>don&#8217;t</em> use Western&nbsp;Union).</li>
<li>Print the emails: Since Gmail wont
  work in China, it is better to print or download
  important emails before&nbsp;arrival.</li>
<li>Use AirBnB: We booked our stay through
  <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/2910033">AirBnB</a>. The host was extremely
  co-operative and always available over WhatsApp.
  It is good to have some local person to rely&nbsp;on.</li>
<li>Buy a sim-card soon: The sim costs around <span class="caps">RMB</span> 70 with
  the data pack. It is a helpful to have it&nbsp;early.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enjoy your trip to&nbsp;China.</strong></p>

    <div class="post">
      <p>I like to use <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> for
trying out new web-applications and scripts. The
cheapest plan comes at $5/month but provides only
<span class="caps">512MB</span> of memory. Adding a 1Gb swap memory is
usually sufficient for temporary memory extensive
needs. These is a short documentation on how to
add the swap&nbsp;partition.</p>
<p>Adding a swap&nbsp;partition:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap bs=1M count=1024</span>
<span class="err">sudo mkswap /swap</span>
<span class="err">sudo swapon /swap</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Making the partition persistent on system&nbsp;reboots:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">sudo vi /etc/fstab</span>
<span class="err"># Add a line to tell the system to use the file</span>
<span class="err">/swap   none    swap    sw  0   0</span>

<small class='sub'>Image credits: <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/99555371@N06/">@Mukesh</a></small></p>
<p>I attended <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2014/">Pycon India</a> during last couple
of days. As always, it felt great to meet so many
smart programmers creating amazing things. These
are my notes from various workshops, talks and
interactions <sup id="fnref:Note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Note">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an interaction with <a href="https://twitter.com/gvrv">@Gaurav</a>, he
mentioned about <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/behave/">Behave library</a> - &#8220;it is
for behaviour-driven development. It is so
intuitive that even a non techy person can write
specs for your code.&#8221; The concept sounds
interesting for writing browser tests with&nbsp;Selenium.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/shshank">@Shashank</a> gave a workshop on &#8220;scraping
even the hardest websites.&#8221; Though I have used
BeautifulSoup <sup id="fnref:Soup"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Soup">2</a></sup> before, using Selenium with
<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> was a new learning. Another interesting note
from the talk was using
<a href="http://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">DeathByCaptcha</a> <span class="caps">API</span> for solving
captchas on&nbsp;websites.</p>
<p>So now my workflow for scraping websites is
something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Traditional <span class="caps">GET</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd>Requests.</dd>

    <dt>Forms / <span class="caps">POST</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd><a href="https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser">RoboBrowser</a>
    (to go around <span class="caps">CSRF</span> and <span class="caps">ASP</span>&nbsp;websites).</dd>

    <dt>Modern&nbsp;single-page-websites</dt>
    <dd>It probably has <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs - use&nbsp;them.</dd>

    <dt>For other Javascript heavy&nbsp;websites</dt>
    <dd>Selenium +&nbsp;PhantomJS.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In another workshop, <a href="https://twitter.com/anandology">@Anand</a> not only
explained us how decorators work, but also
made us do lots of exercises. One can <a href="http://anandology.com/nb/2014/decorators-demystified/">go
through the notebook here</a>. By the end
of the workshop we learned to write our own trace,
memorize / cache and routing&nbsp;decorators.</p>
<p>Apart from decorators, I also learned about
various magic commands in IPython&nbsp;Notebook:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">%</span><span class="nf">%file</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="cp"># Python Code</span>
<span class="cp"># below it will save the code</span>
<span class="cp"># in the given filename</span>

<span class="o">!</span><span class="n">python</span> <span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">py</span>
<span class="cp"># using ! we can run bash-commands</span>

<span class="nf">%magic</span>
<span class="cp"># To see all the available magic commands in IPython</span>
<span class="cp"># (found in an interaction with Eswar Vandanapu)</span>
</pre></div>


<p><a href="https://twitter.com/kushaldas">@Kushal</a> gave a keynote on the importance
of contributing upstream. By going through the
source codes of our favorite programs, we can not
only become a better programmer but also get an
opportunity to contribute to them. I pledge to have
a closer look at the source codes of two of my
favorite Python packages - Rhythmbox and&nbsp;Django.</p>
<p>Guys from <span class="caps">IIT</span> Bhu talked about using
<a href="http://simplecv.org/">SimpleCV</a> to play flappy-birds using
gestures. The library looks quite powerful to do
some interesting stuff with cameras and images. I
have a few toy-ideas in my mind now <sup id="fnref:SimpleCV Ideas"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SimpleCV Ideas">3</a></sup>
- will see how they&nbsp;go.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jace">@Kiran</a> shared the problems he faced while
creating <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">LastUser</a> service. I learned about
database-backed sessions and about how they differ
from cookie based sessions. Kiran also emphasized
on using <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> by showing how easy it was to
hijack sessions using FireSheep on an unsecured&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Django uses database-backed sessions by default.
While digging into the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/sessions/">related documentation</a>, I
found the solution to some of my problems
<sup id="fnref:sessions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sessions">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Second keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cv.shtml">@Michael Foord</a>,
emphasized on moving the projects from
platform-as-a-service (such as Heroku other such
hostings) to infrastructure-as-a-service (such as
Amazon <span class="caps">AWS</span>). A hosting service should be
considered as livestock or sheep instead of as
pet. It should be easily migratable and
redeployable whenever needed. Docker and JuJu are
steps towards&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sanand0">@S Anand</a> presented a talk on &#8220;faster
data processing in python.&#8221; He began with basic
pieces of codes and then optimized them
incrementally - explaining the measurement
techniques and conceptual approach towards
optimization. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM-SgJTi8g0#t=14970">complete talk</a> can be viewed
online, while the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Faster%20Data%20Processing%20in%20Python.ipynb">notebook is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Few important libraries mentioned in the talk&nbsp;were:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler">line_profiler</a></dt>
    <dd>Shows the number of hits and time spent on
    each <i>line of code</i>.</dd>

    <dt>Pandas and&nbsp;Numpy</dt>
    <dd>For performing vector&nbsp;operations.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> @jit&nbsp;decorator</dt>
    <dd>Converts a Python function to efficient machine&nbsp;instruction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>During the lightning talks, <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin">@Vineet</a> showcased his
library <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree">Pipdeptree</a>, which displays all the pip
dependencies in a tree format. It will surely come
quite handy for generating sane <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/originalankur">@Ankur</a> showcased his awesome new project
<a href="http://importpython.com/">ImportPython.com</a> - a <em>customized</em>
Python weekly newsletter. Apart from that, the
website lists all the Python books (free as well
as paid) categorized by reader&#8217;s levels. In future
he plans to bring everything else, including
videos, presentations etc. related to Python at
one&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Together, this is a long list of new libraries and
concepts to try-out and practice. It should keep
me busy well until the next&nbsp;PyCon.</p>

        <a href="https://fully-faltoo.com/2014/08/23/commands/">Useful bash&nbsp;commands</a>
    </h1>
  </header>

  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post">
      <p>These are few of the bash commands I often find&nbsp;useful:</p>
<hr>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><code>z</code></a>: Z allows jumping (<code>cd</code>) into <em>frecently
(i.e. frequently and recently)</em> used directories.
Instead of doing
<code>cd /home/pratyush/websites/project_name</code>
each time, I can now simply do <code>z project_name</code>.
Z supports tab completion too. <strong><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">Link to Z library</a></strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>ps -u &lt;username&gt; -o pid,rss,command | awk '{print $0}{sum+=$2} END {print "Total", sum/1024, "MB"}'</code>:
When accessing remote servers using shell, I often need to
check the list of scripts running and the memory
they are consuming. This command does exactly
that. It is a sort of minimal task-manager. I
found this command <a href="https://community.webfaction.com/questions/8553/how-to-determine-memory-consumption">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>php -S localhost:8888 -t .</code>: Though I am not a
<code>PHP</code> fan (anymore), this command serves the
current directory using a live php server. This
comes handy to tryout a local wordpress
installation by just extracting the&nbsp;package.</p>
<p><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code> is a Python
alternative for starting a live server from
current directory to serve the&nbsp;files.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>netstat -plunt</code>: To see which ports are open and
which application is on each&nbsp;one.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>du file/path -chs</code>: du is the disk-utility
command. This command shows the total size of any
directory. <code>-c</code> is for total, <code>-h</code> is for showing
humanize file sizes and <code>-s</code> for showing only the
summary. I often use this command on web-servers
to find the size of file-system&nbsp;caches.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>ssh-copy-id user@example.com</code>: This appends the
public key to the remote-host for password-less
ssh&nbsp;logins.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>mysqldump -u username -p --all-databases &gt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For creating a backup of all the mysql&nbsp;databases.</p>
<p><code>mysql -u username -p &lt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For restoring all the databases from the&nbsp;dump.</p>
<p>Both of the these mysql commands are high on
performance. These come handy for creating a
backup snapshots of&nbsp;databases.</p>
<p>I found these two commands <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/328922/transfer-mysql-database-to-another-computer/4819610#4819610">here</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>ssh -D 31500 user@example.com</code>: This turns the <span class="caps">SSH</span> client into a <span class="caps">SOCKS</span> proxy server. It provides me a <span class="caps">VPN</span> on the fly. So if a website refuses to open, or is restricted to a particular country, I run this command and then update the proxy settings in Firefox as&nbsp;below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">1. Enable proxy in firefox.</span>
<span class="err">2. Enter &quot;127.0.0.1&quot; for &quot;SOCKS Host&quot;</span>
<span class="err">3. Enter &quot;31500&quot; (or whatever port we chose) for Port.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Full documentation for this trick is available

<p><code>howdoi</code>: <a href="https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi">HowDoI</a> provides answers to
programming questions from command line. Thus
instead of opening a browser and getting
distracted in web, I can now simply type in
something like <code>howdoi convert csv to namedtuple</code>
to get the&nbsp;leads.</p>
<p>I usually pass the <code>-ac</code> arguments: <code>-a</code> provides
the full text of the answer, <code>-c</code> enables
colorized&nbsp;output.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.example.com</code>: <span class="caps">AB</span> is a
poor man&#8217;s website performance benchmarking tool. <code>-c</code>
specifies the number of concurrent requests and
<code>-n</code> specifies the total number of requests to be
sent to a webpage. This comes handy while
migrating websites to new servers or when making
significant frontend&nbsp;changes.</p>
<hr>
<p><code>wget "url" -c</code>: <span class="caps">WGET</span> is for downloading files
from command-line. I often find the download speeds
significantly different in browser&#8217;s built-in
download managers and wget. <code>-c</code> enables the
resume&nbsp;support.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are various other <em>must-know</em> bash commands
such as <code>awk</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>head</code> which are
super-useful in daily work. <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">Akshay</a> has covered
them in a <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">brief tutorial here</a>.</p>
