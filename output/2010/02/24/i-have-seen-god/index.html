<p>It was truly amazing to watch <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">GENIUS</span> at work today. The whole atmosphere was thrilling, adrenaline was flowing and we were happy that we were the part of it. Some years later, we probably would be telling the next generation that yes, we watched the God at work and add another record to his&nbsp;name.</p>

<p><a href="http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/5351/sachintrending.png" target="_blank">Sachin, the word instantly became the trending topic Worldwide</a>. Sachin, the name alone, united the India as Twitter, Google and Cricinfo went down for few&nbsp;moments.</p>

<p><i><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>May be I was 6-7 years old when I dreamt of playing for <span class="caps">INDIA</span>.&#8221; - </i><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF9P8JKYrHs" target="_blank">Sachin&#8217;s Motivation</a>.<br/>That is probably what the passion or clear goal or motivation is. Have a dream - and go for&nbsp;it&#160;!!!</p>

<p>Remembering of Biswaroop Roy Chowdhury&#8217;s seminar, I won&#8217;t be surprised if we see more double tons in one-day cricket now. It was scientifically proven that a person can not run 100 meters in less than 10 seconds until Jim Hines (in 1968) did so. Within a month, more than 16 more people completed 100 meters in less than 10 seconds cause a belief was&nbsp;broken.</p>

<p>Again a belief has been broken by the master-blaster, that 200 is possible in a One-Day Match (without a runner too :D - unlike Saeed Anwars 194). Yes we are about to see many more double tons now; the God has just created another&nbsp;wonder&#160;!!!</p>

<p><span><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><i>Tuzhe pata hai tune kiska catch chhoda hai?</i>&#8221;<br/>- Wasim Akram to Abdul Razzaq when the latter dropped Sachin&#8217;s catch in 2003 <span class="caps">WC</span>.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span><i>Even my father&#8217;s name is Sachin Tendulkar.&#8221;</i><br/>- Tendulkar&#8217;s daughter, Sara, tells her class her father&#8217;s name after the teacher informs them of a restaurant of the same name in&nbsp;Mumbai.</span></span></p>

<p><i>Question: Who do you think as most important celebrity&#160;?<br/>Shah Rukh Khan: There was a big party where stars from bollywood and cricket were invited. Suddenly, there was a big noise, all wanted to see approaching Amitabh Bachhan. Then Sachin entered the hall and Amitabh was leading the queue to get a grab of the <span class="caps">GENIUS</span>!!</i><br/>-  Shah Rukh Khan in an&nbsp;interview.</p>
