</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Reading through the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/lib.html">library</a> of YCombinator, came across <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">this</a> awesome "lesson on elementary worldly wisdom" by Charlie Munger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6% returnâ€”even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result.</p>
<p>So the trick is getting into better businesses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Warren Buffett was a true "Grahamite", and started by investing only in the businesses available at cheap valuations (and even liquidate them if required).</p>
<p>However, Munger realized "that some company that was selling at 2 or 3 times book value could still be a hell of a bargain." It was then that they started thinking about better businesses.</p>
<p>And the "bulk of the billions in Berkshire Hathaway have come from the better businesses."</p>
<p><strong>Do read the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/munger.html">complete lesson</a> if you love investing.</strong></p>
