    <p class="meta sub"><a href="http://fully-faltoo.com/2014/08/23/commands/"><small>Posted on Sat 23 August 2014</small></a>

  </div>
  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post"><p>These are few of the bash commands I often find
useful:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><code>z</code></a>: Z allows jumping (<code>cd</code>) into <em>frecently
(i.e. frequently and recently)</em> used directories.
Insted of doing
<code>cd /home/pratyush/websites/project_name</code>
each time, I can now simply do <code>z project_name</code>.
Z supports tab completion too. <strong><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">Link to Z library</a></strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ps -u &lt;username&gt; -o pid,rss,command | awk '{print $0}{sum+=$2} END {print "Total", sum/1024, "MB"}'</code>:
When accessing remote servers using shell, I often need to
check the list of scripts running and the memory
they are consuming. This command does exactly
that. It is a sort of minimal task-manager. I
found this command <a href="https://community.webfaction.com/questions/8553/how-to-determine-memory-consumption">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>php -S localhost:8888 -t .</code>: Though I am not a
<code>PHP</code> fan (anymore), this command serves the
current directory using a live php server. This
comes handy to tryout a local wordpress
installation by just extracting the package.</p>
<p><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code> is a Python
alternative for starting a live server from
current directory to serve the files.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>du file/path -chs</code>: du is the disk-utility
command. This command shows the total size of any
directory. <code>-c</code> is for total, <code>-h</code> is for showing
humanize file sizes and <code>-s</code> for showing only the
summary. I often use this command on web-servers
to find the size of file-system caches.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ssh-copy-id user@example.com</code>: This appends the
public key to the remote-host for password-less
ssh logins.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>mysqldump -u username -p --all-databases &gt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For creating a backup of all the mysql databases.</p>
<p><code>mysql -u username -p &lt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For restoring all the databases from the dump.</p>
<p>Both of the these mysql commands are high on
performance. These come handy for creating a
backup snapshots of databases.</p>
<p>I found these two commands [here][].</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ssh -D 31500 user@example.com</code>: This turns the SSH client into a SOCKS proxy server. It provides me a VPN on the fly. So if a website refuses to open, or is restricted to a particular country, I run this command and then update the proxy settings in Firefox as below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="n">Enable</span> <span class="n">proxy</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">firefox</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="s">&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s">&quot;SOCKS Host&quot;</span>
<span class="mf">3.</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="s">&quot;31500&quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">or</span> <span class="n">whatever</span> <span class="n">port</span> <span class="n">we</span> <span class="n">chose</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">Port</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Full documentation for this trick is available
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding#Dynamic_Port_Forwarding">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>howdoi</code>: <a href="https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi">HowDoI</a> provides answers to
programming questions from command line. Thus
instead of opening a browser and getting
distracted in web, I can now simply type in
something like <code>howdoi convert csv to namedtuple</code>
to get the leads.</p>
<p>I usually pass the <code>-ac</code> arguments: <code>-a</code> provides
the full text of the answer, <code>-c</code> enables
colorized output.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.example.com</code>: AB is a
poor man's website performance benchmarking tool. <code>-c</code>
specifies the number of concurrent requests and
<code>-n</code> specifies the total number of requests to be
sent to a webpage. This comes handy while
migrating websites to new servers or when making
significant frontend changes.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>wget "url" -c</code>: WGET is for downloading files
from command-line. I often find the download speeds
significantly different in browser's built-in
download managers and wget. <code>-c</code> enables the
resume support.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are various other <em>must-know</em> bash commands
such as <code>awk</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>head</code> which are
super-useful in daily work. <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">Akshay</a> has covered
them in a <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">brief tutorial here</a>.</p>    </div>

    <h1><a href="http://fully-faltoo.com/2013/11/16/dhoni/">Dhoni&#39;s advice to young players</a>    </h1>
    <p class="meta sub"><a href="http://fully-faltoo.com/2013/11/16/dhoni/"><small>Posted on Sat 16 November 2013</small></a>
    </p>

  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post"><p><img alt="Dhoni's shot in world cup final 2011" src="http://fully-faltoo.com/uploads/dhoni.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of all the sportsmen, I admire MS Dhoni and Brian Lara the
most. Whether India wins or not, I try to hear his words
and learn from his temperament. Found this <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2013/apr/230413-ms-dhoni-sports-psychologist-rudi-webster-interview.htm">wonderful
interview</a> of Dhoni where he talks about the role
of mind, and gives advice on how to be a better player.
These advice apply as well to other things as to cricket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to a young player who wants
to improve his game?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, I would tell him that he <strong>must love and
enjoy his sport</strong>. If he does not enjoy it he would not
learn to play the game as quickly or as well as he should.
Second, I would tell him to <strong>keep things simple</strong>. The more
he complicates the process the harder it will be for him
to improve his game. For example, when he tells himself to
watch the ball and play it on its merits, he might have
other thoughts like scoring runs or not getting out in his
mind.</p>
<p>Those thoughts can break his concentration and prevent him
from watching the ball. If he knows that the bowler can
bowl an out-swinger, an in-swinger and a good bouncer as
well, he has three other things to think about. But the
more he thinks about what the bowler might do the more
complex and difficult batting becomes.</p>
<p>Third, I would tell him to capitalise on his strengths,
improve his weaknesses and recognise his limitations.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about the problems players face when
they have to play in conditions that are foreign to them.
For instance, when Indian batsmen who are brought up on
slow flat wickets have to play on the fast and bouncy
wickets in Australia and South Africa.</p>
<p>When I go to Australia or South Africa I <strong>try to be
positive and see the visit as a challenge and an
opportunity to explore, learn and improve my game</strong>. I try
not to be negative or worry about the pace and bounce of
the wickets or the things that could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and improvement take time.</strong> When you leave nursery
school you don’t expect to go straight into a graduate
school. In the following years you slowly improve as a
student and when you reach a certain standard you graduate
and afterwards go on to higher levels. The same thing
happens in sport.</p>
<p>The player should therefore <strong>be patient and persistent and
he should keep things simple and enjoy his sport.</strong> Not only
should he enjoy his own performance on the field but he
should also <strong>get pleasure from sharing his experiences with
other players and from creating an atmosphere that helps
the guy sitting next to him in the dressing room to
perform better.</strong></p>
<p>This is one area where the Indian team is very blessed.
The senior players in our team have helped the younger
players to learn, develop and perform better. Your
individual performance is important but how much better
you help your teammate to play better is equally
important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was just one of the passages from the <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2013/apr/230413-ms-dhoni-sports-psychologist-rudi-webster-interview.htm">complete

again and again at regular intervals.</p>    </div>
