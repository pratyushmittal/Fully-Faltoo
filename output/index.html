    <p class="meta sub"><a href="http://fully-faltoo.com/2014/09/28/pycon/"><small>Posted on Sun 28 September 2014</small></a>

  </div>
  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post"><p>I attended <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2014/">Pycon India</a> during last couple
of days. As always, it felt great to meet so many
smart programmers creating amazing things. These
are my notes from various workshops, talks and
interactions <sup id="fnref:Note"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Note" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In an interaction with <a href="https://twitter.com/gvrv">@Gaurav</a>, he
mentioned about <a href="http://pythonhosted.org/behave/">Behave library</a> - &#8220;it is
for behaviour-driven development. It is so
intuitive that even a non techy person can write
specs for your code.&#8221; The concept sounds
interesting for writing browser tests with&nbsp;Selenium.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/shshank">@Shashank</a> gave a workshop on &#8220;scraping
even the hardest websites.&#8221; Though I have used
BeautifulSoup <sup id="fnref:Soup"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:Soup" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> before, using Selenium with
<a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> was a new learning. Another interesting note
from the talk was using
<a href="http://www.deathbycaptcha.com/">DeathByCaptcha</a> <span class="caps">API</span> for solving
captchas on&nbsp;websites.</p>
<p>So now my workflow for scraping websites is
something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Traditional <span class="caps">GET</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd>Requests.</dd>

    <dt>Forms / <span class="caps">POST</span>&nbsp;requests</dt>
    <dd><a href="https://github.com/jmcarp/robobrowser">RoboBrowser</a>
    (to go around <span class="caps">CSRF</span> and <span class="caps">ASP</span>&nbsp;websites).</dd>

    <dt>Modern&nbsp;single-page-websites</dt>
    <dd>It probably has <span class="caps">REST</span> APIs - use&nbsp;them.</dd>

    <dt>For other Javascript heavy&nbsp;websites</dt>
    <dd>Selenium +&nbsp;PhantomJS.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In another workshop, <a href="https://twitter.com/anandology">@Anand</a> not only
explained us how decorators work, but also
made us do lots of exercises. One can <a href="http://anandology.com/nb/2014/decorators-demystified/">go
through the notebook here</a>. By the end
of the workshop we learned to write our own trace,
memorize / cache and routing&nbsp;decorators.</p>
<p>Apart from decorators, I also learned about
various magic commands in IPython&nbsp;Notebook:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">%%file filename.py</span>

</pre></div>


<p>Guys from <span class="caps">IIT</span> Bhu talked about using
<a href="http://simplecv.org/">SimpleCV</a> to play flappy-birds using
gestures. The library looks quite powerful to do
some interesting stuff with cameras and images. I
have a few toy-ideas in my mind now <sup id="fnref:SimpleCV Ideas"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:SimpleCV Ideas" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>
- will see how they&nbsp;go.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jace">@Kiran</a> shared the problems he faced while
creating <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">LastUser</a> service. I learned about
database-backed sessions and about how they differ
from cookie based sessions. Kiran also emphasized
on using <span class="caps">HTTPS</span> by showing how easy it was to
hijack sessions using FireSheep on an unsecured&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>Django uses database-backed sessions by default.
While digging into the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/sessions/">related documentation</a>, I
found the solution to some of my problems
<sup id="fnref:sessions"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:sessions" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Second keynote speaker, <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cv.shtml">@Michael Foord</a>,
emphasized on moving the projects from
platform-as-a-service (such as Heroku other such
hostings) to infrastructure-as-a-service (such as
Amazon <span class="caps">AWS</span>). The hosting services should be
considered as livestock or sheeps instead of as
pets. They should be easily migratable and
redeployable whenever needed. Docker and JuJu are
steps towards&nbsp;that.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sanand0">@S Anand</a> presented a talk on &#8220;faster
data processing in python.&#8221; He began with basic
pieces of codes and then optimized them
incrementally - explaining the measurement
techniques and conceptual approach towards
optimization. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jM-SgJTi8g0#t=14970">complete talk</a> can be viewed
online, while the <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sanand0/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Faster%20Data%20Processing%20in%20Python.ipynb">notebook is available here</a>.</p>
<p>Few important libraries mentioned in the talk&nbsp;were:</p>
<dl>
    <dt><a href="https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler">line_profiler</a></dt>
    <dd>Shows the number of hits and time spent on
    each <i>line of code</i>.</dd>

    <dt>Pandas and&nbsp;Numpy</dt>
    <dd>For performing vector&nbsp;operations.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> @jit&nbsp;decorator</dt>
    <dd>Converts a Python function to efficient machine&nbsp;instruction.</dd>
</dl>

<p>During the lightning talks, <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin">@Vineet</a> showcased his
library <a href="https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree">Pipdeptree</a>, which displays all the pip
dependencies in a tree format. It will surely come
quite handy for generating sane <code>requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/originalankur">@Ankur</a> showcased his awesome new project
<a href="http://importpython.com/">ImportPython.com</a> - a <em>customized</em>
Python weekly newsletter. Apart from that, the
website lists all the Python books (free as well
as paid) categorized by reader&#8217;s levels. In future
he plans to bring everything else, including
videos, presentations etc. related to Python at
one&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Together, this is a long list of new libraries and
concepts to try-out and practice. It should keep
me busy well until the next&nbsp;PyCon.</p>

<li id="fn:Note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is <em>not a post about
everything</em> interesting that happened at the
event. There were many other interesting talks and
workshops. These are only the things I noted down
during the event to implement them in my projects
at sometime.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:Note" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p><strong>Toy-ideas:</strong>
1. Write a script to take images each time I open

<li id="fn:sessions">
<p>In a database-backed session, a
session row is created in the database on each
user login. The encrypted id of this row is stored
in the user&#8217;s cookie. On each <code>is_authenticated()</code>
call, this session row is fetched. Thus this can be
used to store session data of any size without
incurring any additional overhead - example use
cases: storing user&#8217;s votes, alerts, carts,
trackers etc to show &#8220;already voted or item
present in cart&#8221; flags.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:sessions" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

    <p class="meta sub"><a href="http://fully-faltoo.com/2014/08/23/commands/"><small>Posted on Sat 23 August 2014</small></a>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="page-content">
    <div class="post"><p>These are few of the bash commands I often find&nbsp;useful:</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z"><code>z</code></a>: Z allows jumping (<code>cd</code>) into <em>frecently
(i.e. frequently and recently)</em> used directories.
Insted of doing
<code>cd /home/pratyush/websites/project_name</code>
each time, I can now simply do <code>z project_name</code>.
Z supports tab completion too. <strong><a href="https://github.com/rupa/z">Link to Z library</a></strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ps -u &lt;username&gt; -o pid,rss,command | awk '{print $0}{sum+=$2} END {print "Total", sum/1024, "MB"}'</code>:
When accessing remote servers using shell, I often need to
check the list of scripts running and the memory
they are consuming. This command does exactly
that. It is a sort of minimal task-manager. I
found this command <a href="https://community.webfaction.com/questions/8553/how-to-determine-memory-consumption">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>php -S localhost:8888 -t .</code>: Though I am not a
<code>PHP</code> fan (anymore), this command serves the
current directory using a live php server. This
comes handy to tryout a local wordpress
installation by just extracting the&nbsp;package.</p>
<p><code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080</code> is a Python
alternative for starting a live server from
current directory to serve the&nbsp;files.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>du file/path -chs</code>: du is the disk-utility
command. This command shows the total size of any
directory. <code>-c</code> is for total, <code>-h</code> is for showing
humanize file sizes and <code>-s</code> for showing only the
summary. I often use this command on web-servers
to find the size of file-system&nbsp;caches.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ssh-copy-id user@example.com</code>: This appends the
public key to the remote-host for password-less
ssh&nbsp;logins.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>mysqldump -u username -p --all-databases &gt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For creating a backup of all the mysql&nbsp;databases.</p>
<p><code>mysql -u username -p &lt; alldbs.sql</code>:
For restoring all the databases from the&nbsp;dump.</p>
<p>Both of the these mysql commands are high on
performance. These come handy for creating a
backup snapshots of&nbsp;databases.</p>
<p>I found these two commands <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/328922/transfer-mysql-database-to-another-computer/4819610#4819610">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ssh -D 31500 user@example.com</code>: This turns the <span class="caps">SSH</span> client into a <span class="caps">SOCKS</span> proxy server. It provides me a <span class="caps">VPN</span> on the fly. So if a website refuses to open, or is restricted to a particular country, I run this command and then update the proxy settings in Firefox as&nbsp;below:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="n">Enable</span> <span class="n">proxy</span> <span class="n">in</span> <span class="n">firefox</span><span class="p">.</span>
<span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="s">&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="s">&quot;SOCKS Host&quot;</span>
<span class="mf">3.</span> <span class="n">Enter</span> <span class="s">&quot;31500&quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">or</span> <span class="n">whatever</span> <span class="n">port</span> <span class="n">we</span> <span class="n">chose</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">Port</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Full documentation for this trick is available
<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/PortForwarding#Dynamic_Port_Forwarding">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>howdoi</code>: <a href="https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi">HowDoI</a> provides answers to
programming questions from command line. Thus
instead of opening a browser and getting
distracted in web, I can now simply type in
something like <code>howdoi convert csv to namedtuple</code>
to get the&nbsp;leads.</p>
<p>I usually pass the <code>-ac</code> arguments: <code>-a</code> provides
the full text of the answer, <code>-c</code> enables
colorized&nbsp;output.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>ab -n 100 -c 10 http://www.example.com</code>: <span class="caps">AB</span> is a
poor man&#8217;s website performance benchmarking tool. <code>-c</code>
specifies the number of concurrent requests and
<code>-n</code> specifies the total number of requests to be
sent to a webpage. This comes handy while
migrating websites to new servers or when making
significant frontend&nbsp;changes.</p>
<hr />
<p><code>wget "url" -c</code>: <span class="caps">WGET</span> is for downloading files
from command-line. I often find the download speeds
significantly different in browser&#8217;s built-in
download managers and wget. <code>-c</code> enables the
resume&nbsp;support.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are various other <em>must-know</em> bash commands
such as <code>awk</code>, <code>uniq</code>, <code>head</code> which are
super-useful in daily work. <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">Akshay</a> has covered
them in a <a href="http://datavu.blogspot.in/2014/08/useful-unix-commands-for-exploring-data.html">brief tutorial here</a>.</p>    </div>

    <div class="post"><p><img alt="Dhoni's shot in world cup final 2011" src="http://fully-faltoo.com/uploads/dhoni.jpg" /></p>
<p>Of all the sportsmen, I admire <span class="caps">MS</span> Dhoni and Brian Lara the
most. Whether India wins or not, I try to hear his words
and learn from his temperament. Found this <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2013/apr/230413-ms-dhoni-sports-psychologist-rudi-webster-interview.htm">wonderful
interview</a> of Dhoni where he talks about the role
of mind, and gives advice on how to be a better player.
These advice apply as well to other things as to&nbsp;cricket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to a young player who wants
to improve his&nbsp;game?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, I would tell him that he <strong>must love and
enjoy his sport</strong>. If he does not enjoy it he would not
learn to play the game as quickly or as well as he should.
Second, I would tell him to <strong>keep things simple</strong>. The more
he complicates the process the harder it will be for him
to improve his game. For example, when he tells himself to
watch the ball and play it on its merits, he might have
other thoughts like scoring runs or not getting out in his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Those thoughts can break his concentration and prevent him
from watching the ball. If he knows that the bowler can
bowl an out-swinger, an in-swinger and a good bouncer as
well, he has three other things to think about. But the
more he thinks about what the bowler might do the more
complex and difficult batting&nbsp;becomes.</p>
<p>Third, I would tell him to capitalise on his strengths,
improve his weaknesses and recognise his&nbsp;limitations.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about the problems players face when
they have to play in conditions that are foreign to them.
For instance, when Indian batsmen who are brought up on
slow flat wickets have to play on the fast and bouncy
wickets in Australia and South&nbsp;Africa.</p>
<p>When I go to Australia or South Africa I <strong>try to be
positive and see the visit as a challenge and an
opportunity to explore, learn and improve my game</strong>. I try
not to be negative or worry about the pace and bounce of
the wickets or the things that could possibly go&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and improvement take time.</strong> When you leave nursery
school you don’t expect to go straight into a graduate
school. In the following years you slowly improve as a
student and when you reach a certain standard you graduate
and afterwards go on to higher levels. The same thing
happens in&nbsp;sport.</p>
<p>The player should therefore <strong>be patient and persistent and
he should keep things simple and enjoy his sport.</strong> Not only
should he enjoy his own performance on the field but he
should also <strong>get pleasure from sharing his experiences with
other players and from creating an atmosphere that helps
the guy sitting next to him in the dressing room to
perform&nbsp;better.</strong></p>
<p>This is one area where the Indian team is very blessed.
The senior players in our team have helped the younger
players to learn, develop and perform better. Your
individual performance is important but how much better
you help your teammate to play better is equally&nbsp;important.</p>
