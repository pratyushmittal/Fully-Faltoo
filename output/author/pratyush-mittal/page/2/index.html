      <p>I celebrated the new year on a vacation with a
group of friends. One of the best time-pass was
the group game of <a href="http://maxistentialism.com/werewolf/">Werewolf</a>.</p>
<p>Be it a bus journey, waiting at a stop or a late
night hangout on a beach, we played Werewolf
everywhere. It required only some chits of paper
(though we used a playing deck as a better&nbsp;substitute).</p>
<p>It requires minimum 7 players and is best
experienced with 10-12&nbsp;players.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a
large group, scope to shout, and time to go
through the&nbsp;rulebook.</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;&#8212;Update on April&nbsp;2015&#8212;&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>I found the rules for another variation of this
game: <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/109882/english-rules-one-night-ultimate-werewolf">One Night Ultimate Werewolf</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://fully-faltoo.com/uploads/werewolf.pdf">Mirror</a> of the above rule&nbsp;book.</p>

<p>Of all the sportsmen, I admire <span class="caps">MS</span> Dhoni and Brian Lara the
most. Whether India wins or not, I try to hear his words
and learn from his temperament. Found this <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2013/apr/230413-ms-dhoni-sports-psychologist-rudi-webster-interview.htm">wonderful
interview</a> of Dhoni where he talks about the role
of mind, and gives advice on how to be a better player.
These advice apply as well to other things as to&nbsp;cricket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to a young player who wants
to improve his&nbsp;game?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, I would tell him that he <strong>must love and
enjoy his sport</strong>. If he does not enjoy it he would not
learn to play the game as quickly or as well as he should.
Second, I would tell him to <strong>keep things simple</strong>. The more
he complicates the process the harder it will be for him
to improve his game. For example, when he tells himself to
watch the ball and play it on its merits, he might have
other thoughts like scoring runs or not getting out in his&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>Those thoughts can break his concentration and prevent him
from watching the ball. If he knows that the bowler can
bowl an out-swinger, an in-swinger and a good bouncer as
well, he has three other things to think about. But the
more he thinks about what the bowler might do the more
complex and difficult batting&nbsp;becomes.</p>
<p>Third, I would tell him to capitalise on his strengths,
improve his weaknesses and recognise his&nbsp;limitations.</p>
<p>A lot of people talk about the problems players face when
they have to play in conditions that are foreign to them.
For instance, when Indian batsmen who are brought up on
slow flat wickets have to play on the fast and bouncy
wickets in Australia and South&nbsp;Africa.</p>
<p>When I go to Australia or South Africa I <strong>try to be
positive and see the visit as a challenge and an
opportunity to explore, learn and improve my game</strong>. I try
not to be negative or worry about the pace and bounce of
the wickets or the things that could possibly go&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Learning and improvement take time.</strong> When you leave nursery
school you don’t expect to go straight into a graduate
school. In the following years you slowly improve as a
student and when you reach a certain standard you graduate
and afterwards go on to higher levels. The same thing
happens in&nbsp;sport.</p>
<p>The player should therefore <strong>be patient and persistent and
he should keep things simple and enjoy his sport.</strong> Not only
should he enjoy his own performance on the field but he
should also <strong>get pleasure from sharing his experiences with
other players and from creating an atmosphere that helps
the guy sitting next to him in the dressing room to
perform&nbsp;better.</strong></p>
<p>This is one area where the Indian team is very blessed.
The senior players in our team have helped the younger
players to learn, develop and perform better. Your
individual performance is important but how much better
you help your teammate to play better is equally&nbsp;important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was just one of the passages from the <a href="http://www.mid-day.com/sports/2013/apr/230413-ms-dhoni-sports-psychologist-rudi-webster-interview.htm">complete
interview</a>. Would try to go through the interview
again and again at regular&nbsp;intervals.</p>

      <p>I have two separate projects and both use a common set of directories. Since both the projects are under active development, I symlinked the common files. Thus the changes were incorporated in both the projects. <strong>However, git <em>does not</em> follow the symbolic links and instead saves its&nbsp;contents.</strong></p>
<p>To solve it&nbsp;I:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copied one of the projects into the another as a subdirectory using&nbsp;subtree.</li>
<li>Created symlinks from inside this subtree&nbsp;directory.</li>
<li>Changed the absolute paths of symbolic links into relative&nbsp;paths.</li>
<li>Automated all of the above into a&nbsp;script.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Detailed&nbsp;steps</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Subtree is useful (and better than submodule) for including a project into another project as a subdirectory. The main advantage is that the changes are both downstream as well as upstream. I followed <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/562950/GitplusSubtreeplusMergeplus-e2-80-93TheplusQuickpl">this post</a> to include the project as subtree&nbsp;sub-directory.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next step was to convert all the old symlinks (directly from main project) to symlinks from the new subtree directory. To find all the symbolic links in a directory use <code>$ find /path -type l</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> The symlinks created usually contain absolute file paths (even though they might be in the same git project). Use the <a href="http://bashscripts.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=457">symlinks utility</a> to convert all the symlinks from absolute paths to relative&nbsp;paths.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ sudo apt-get install symlinks
$ symlinks -tscr .  <span class="c1"># Preview changes</span>
$ symlinks -scr .   <span class="c1"># Execute changes</span>
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> To automate all of the above, I compiled and saved the above commands in a fab file to run while committing the&nbsp;changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sync_down</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Syncs downstream from remote to local branch&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git checkout remote_branch&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git pull&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git checkout master&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;git merge --squash -s subtree &#39;</span>
          <span class="s1">&#39;--no-commit &#39;</span>
          <span class="s1">&#39;remote_branch&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sync_up</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;Syncs upstream from local to remote branch&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git checkout remote_branch&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;git merge --squash -s subtree &#39;</span>
          <span class="s1">&#39;--no-commit &#39;</span>
          <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;git add . -A&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;git commit -m &quot;Merged changes from remote&quot;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git push remote remote_branch:master&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;git checkout master&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>


<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">sync_all</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">local</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;symlinks -scr .&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">sync_down</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">sync_up</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>I agree that this is a very hacky way to achieve a simple following of symlinks. However, all the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/86402/how-can-i-get-git-to-follow-symlinks">other</a> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1500772/getting-git-to-follow-symlinks-again">workarounds</a> looked as&nbsp;bad. </p>
