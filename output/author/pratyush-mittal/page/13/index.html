      <p>Either of those can come first. What is important is that the other should follow.  You might read an interesting quote, be told about a good investment, develop a liking for something, want to take an impulsive decision…; since these all are controlled by left brain, it is necessary and helpful to support it with proper&nbsp;logics.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you might have finished with lot of theory, attended an interesting talk, read a news article, read a good book…; these are processed by right brain. To get accustomed to them, one needs to apply them practically and develop it as a part of left&nbsp;brain.</p>

<p>To summarize, if a new thought / idea comes, then develop logics. And if a new thing is learnt, then try to develop a mental model for&nbsp;it.</p>

      <p>Want to respond to letters - complete the report - read a book - spend quality time with&nbsp;family?</p>

<p>Try turning off the router for an hour. <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3w3/how_to_beat_procrastination/" target="_blank">Handling impulsiveness is easy</a>, you just have&nbsp;to:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Throw away the key: Close off tempting&nbsp;alternatives.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Setup a couple of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH-z5kmVhzU" target="_blank">Pomodoros</a> to complete the job; or talk the matters with your complete presence. Don&#8217;t let your impulsiveness distract you! Your job will end up better and your clients will be&nbsp;happier.</p>

<p>Similar &#8220;tempting alternatives&#8221; might include: phone, television, tickers, IMs etc. When work starts expanding, turn these off - focus, and you can happily return to them after&nbsp;that.</p>

      <p>You can stay afraid forever&nbsp;of:</p>

<p>- a subject (taxation, particular disease, English grammar,&nbsp;politics),</p>

<p>- a term (<span class="caps">SQL</span> joints, standard deviation, <span class="caps">VLOOKUP</span>, Piotroski&nbsp;score),</p>

<p>- a method/framework (organisation manuals, guidance notes, new technology, Gmail, Linux),&nbsp;or</p>

<p>- an activity (swimming, public speaking,&nbsp;driving)</p>

<p>or get into its depth, learn about it, practice it and become its master. It might take some time and patience to learn something new (especially when you fear it), but you will soon realize that you have removed a&nbsp;bottleneck.</p>

<p>So start taming your&nbsp;fears!</p>

      <p>Both, a new favorable idea as well as an opposing thought should be noted&nbsp;down.</p>

<p>You think of a new feature for your application; a more usable design for your website; a new investment idea; a new blog post; a seminar that your read about&#8230;the key to their execution lies in making a note of&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Darwin wrote in his&nbsp;autobiography:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I had &#8230; during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed by my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable&nbsp;ones.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Darwin emphasized even more on noting down opposing or unfavorable thoughts. For a split moment, your mind might ask - can the hard-disk crash; do I have a backup of all my digital pictures; can the seats become unavailable; can there be down-time&#8230;if a note is not made of these thoughts then they might just escape, or even worst, you might end up satisfying yourself that it won&#8217;t/can&#8217;t&nbsp;happen.</p>
