<blockquote>We’ll begin with a box, and the plural is boxes, <br/>But the plural of ox becomes oxen, not oxes.<br/>One fowl is a goose, but two are called geese,<br/>Yet the plural of moose should never be meese.<br/>You may find a lone mouse or a nest full of mice,<br/>Yet the plural of house is houses, not hice. <br/><br/>If the plural of man is always called men,<br/>Then shouldn’t the plural of pan be called pen?<br/>If I speak of my foot and show you my feet,<br/>And I give you a boot, would a pair be called beet?<br/>If one is a tooth and a whole s et are teeth, <br/>Why shouldn’t the plural of booth be called beeth?<br/><br/>Then one may be that, and three would be those,<br/>Yet hat in the plural would never be hose,<br/>And the plural of cat is cats, not cose.<br/>We speak of a brother and also of brethren, <br/>But though we say mother, we never say methren.<br/>Then the masculine pronouns are he, his and him,<br/>But imagine the feminine: she, shis and shim!<br/><br/>Let’s face it - English is a crazy language.<br/>There is no egg in eggplant nor ham in hamburger; <br/>neither apple nor pine in pineapple.<br/>English muffins weren’t invented in England.<br/>We take English for granted, but if we explore its paradoxes,<br/>we find that quicksand can work slowly, boxing rings are square, <br/>and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig.<br/><br/>And why is it that writers write but fingers don’t fing,<br/>grocers don’t groce and hammers don’t ham?<br/>Doesn’t it seem crazy that you can make amends but not one amend. <br/>If you have a bunch of odds and ends<br/>and get rid of all but one of them, what do you call it?<br/><br/>If teachers taught, why didn’t preachers praught?<br/>If a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? <br/>Sometimes I think all the folks who grew up speaking English<br/>should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane.<br/><br/>In what other language do people recite at a play and play at a recital?<br/>We ship by truck but send cargo by ship. <br/>We have noses that run and feet that smell.<br/>We park in a driveway and drive in a parkway.<br/>And how can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same,<br/>while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites?<br/><br/>You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language <br/>in which your house can burn up as it burns down, <br/>in which you fill in a form by filling it out, and in which an alarm goes off by going on.<br/><br/>And, in closing, if Father is Pop,  how come Mother’s not Mop? <br/><br/>AND IF PEOPLE FROM POLAND ARE CALLED POLES THEN PEOPLE FROM HOLLAND SHOULD BE HOLES AND THE GERMANS, GERMS <br/></blockquote>    </div>
