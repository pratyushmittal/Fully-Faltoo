<p>What a tournament it was - couldn&#8217;t have asked for anything more. Beating Ausies the previous Champions in Quarter Finals, Pakistan in Semis (by counter attacking their aggressive bowling attack) and Sri Lanka in Finals (in a wonderful run chase); this was surely the most well deserved&nbsp;victory.</p>

<p>What followed in the streets of the country was even more amazing. Never before (yes, never ever before) have I seen such a happiness, unity and merry making among crowds. There were more than 3000 people in the streets of Hazratganj (the heart of the City) at 1 past mid-night. No-one was saying anything, just shouting with happiness and congratulating each other with smiling faces. We saw the real youth of the nation all charged&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>The victory of the World Cup has instilled an all new faith among us. Yas, we have done it and yas, we <span class="caps">WILL</span> <span class="caps">REPEAT</span> <span class="caps">IT</span>. Also, it was a complete team effort, with everyone having a part to&nbsp;play.</p>

<p>Thank you Dhoni for your amazing management skills (you are the &#8220;Man&#8221; as defined in Poem &#8220;If&#8221; by Rudyard Kipling) on field; thanks Sachin for showing us a face of God; thanks Yuvi for teaching us to &#8220;Work Hard - Party <span class="caps">HARDER</span>&#8221;; thanks Raina for taking away the fear for we always knew that you will take care; thanks Zaheer for showing that regular practice makes champions (will never forget your first 3 maidens as compared to 1st ball of 2003 final); thanks Gambhir <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Virat for I know there is still a bright future even after Sachin retires; thanks Sehwag for inspiring us to be ourselves; thanks Munaf for it is wonderful to be so down to earth; thanks Bhajji for you are the face of excitement; thanks Nehra for teaching us to believe in&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
