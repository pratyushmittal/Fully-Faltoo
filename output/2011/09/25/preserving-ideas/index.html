      <p>Both, a new favorable idea as well as an opposing thought should be noted&nbsp;down.</p>

<p>You think of a new feature for your application; a more usable design for your website; a new investment idea; a new blog post; a seminar that your read about&#8230;the key to their execution lies in making a note of&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Darwin wrote in his&nbsp;autobiography:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I had &#8230; during many years, followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed by my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from memory than favorable&nbsp;ones.&#8221;</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Darwin emphasized even more on noting down opposing or unfavorable thoughts. For a split moment, your mind might ask - can the hard-disk crash; do I have a backup of all my digital pictures; can the seats become unavailable; can there be down-time&#8230;if a note is not made of these thoughts then they might just escape, or even worst, you might end up satisfying yourself that it won&#8217;t/can&#8217;t&nbsp;happen.</p>
